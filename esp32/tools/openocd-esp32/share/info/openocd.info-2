13 Flash Programming
********************

OpenOCD implements numerous ways to program the target flash, whether
internal or external.  Programming can be achieved by either using *note
Programming using GDB: programmingusinggdb, or using the commands given
in *note Flash Programming Commands: flashprogrammingcommands.


To simplify using the flash commands directly a jimtcl script is
available that handles the programming and verify stage.  OpenOCD will
program/verify/reset the target and optionally shutdown.

The script is executed as follows and by default the following actions
will be performed.
  1. 'init' is executed.
  2. 'reset init' is called to reset and halt the target, any 'reset
     init' scripts are executed.
  3. 'flash write_image' is called to erase and write any flash using
     the filename given.
  4. If the 'preverify' parameter is given, the target is "verified"
     first and only flashed if this fails.
  5. 'verify_image' is called if 'verify' parameter is given.
  6. 'reset run' is called if 'reset' parameter is given.
  7. OpenOCD is shutdown if 'exit' parameter is given.

An example of usage is given below.  *Note program::.

     # program and verify using elf/hex/s19. verify and reset
     # are optional parameters
     openocd -f board/stm32f3discovery.cfg \
     	-c "program filename.elf verify reset exit"

     # binary files need the flash address passing
     openocd -f board/stm32f3discovery.cfg \
     	-c "program filename.bin exit 0x08000000"

14 PLD/FPGA Commands
********************

Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs) and the more flexible Field
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are both types of programmable
hardware.  OpenOCD can support programming them.  Although PLDs are
generally restrictive (cells are less functional, and there are no
special purpose cells for memory or computational tasks), they share the
same OpenOCD infrastructure.  Accordingly, both are called PLDs here.

14.1 PLD/FPGA Configuration and Commands
========================================

As it does for JTAG TAPs, debug targets, and flash chips (both NOR and
NAND), OpenOCD maintains a list of PLDs available for use in various
commands.  Also, each such PLD requires a driver.

They are referenced by the number shown by the 'pld devices' command,
and new PLDs are defined by 'pld device driver_name'.

 -- Config Command: pld device driver_name tap_name [driver_options]
     Defines a new PLD device, supported by driver DRIVER_NAME, using
     the TAP named TAP_NAME.  The driver may make use of any
     DRIVER_OPTIONS to configure its behavior.

 -- Command: pld devices
     Lists the PLDs and their numbers.

 -- Command: pld load num filename
     Loads the file 'filename' into the PLD identified by NUM.  The file
     format must be inferred by the driver.

14.2 PLD/FPGA Drivers, Options, and Commands
============================================

Drivers may support PLD-specific options to the 'pld device' definition
command, and may also define commands usable only with that particular
type of PLD.

 -- FPGA Driver: virtex2 [no_jstart]
     Virtex-II is a family of FPGAs sold by Xilinx.  It supports the
     IEEE 1532 standard for In-System Configuration (ISC).

     If NO_JSTART is non-zero, the JSTART instruction is not used after
     loading the bitstream.  While required for Series2, Series3, and
     Series6, it breaks bitstream loading on Series7.

      -- Command: virtex2 read_stat num
          Reads and displays the Virtex-II status register (STAT) for
          FPGA NUM.

15 General Commands
*******************

The commands documented in this chapter here are common commands that
you, as a human, may want to type and see the output of.  Configuration
type commands are documented elsewhere.

Intent:
   * Source Of Commands
     OpenOCD commands can occur in a configuration script (discussed
     elsewhere) or typed manually by a human or supplied
     programmatically, or via one of several TCP/IP Ports.

   * From the human
     A human should interact with the telnet interface (default port:
     4444) or via GDB (default port 3333).

     To issue commands from within a GDB session, use the 'monitor'
     command, e.g.  use 'monitor poll' to issue the 'poll' command.  All
     output is relayed through the GDB session.

   * Machine Interface The Tcl interface's intent is to be a machine
     interface.  The default Tcl port is 5555.

15.1 Server Commands
====================

 -- Command: exit
     Exits the current telnet session.

 -- Command: help [string]
     With no parameters, prints help text for all commands.  Otherwise,
     prints each helptext containing STRING.  Not every command provides
     helptext.

     Configuration commands, and commands valid at any time, are
     explicitly noted in parenthesis.  In most cases, no such
     restriction is listed; this indicates commands which are only
     available after the configuration stage has completed.

 -- Command: usage [string]
     With no parameters, prints usage text for all commands.  Otherwise,
     prints all usage text of which command, help text, and usage text
     containing STRING.  Not every command provides helptext.

 -- Command: sleep msec ['busy']
     Wait for at least MSEC milliseconds before resuming.  If 'busy' is
     passed, busy-wait instead of sleeping.  (This option is strongly
     discouraged.)  Useful in connection with script files ('script'
     command and 'target_name' configuration).

 -- Command: shutdown ['error']
     Close the OpenOCD server, disconnecting all clients (GDB, telnet,
     other).  If option 'error' is used, OpenOCD will return a non-zero
     exit code to the parent process.

     If user types CTRL-C or kills OpenOCD, the command 'shutdown' will
     be automatically executed to cause OpenOCD to exit.

     It is possible to specify, in the TCL list PRE_SHUTDOWN_COMMANDS ,
     a set of commands to be automatically executed before 'shutdown' ,
     e.g.:
          lappend pre_shutdown_commands {echo "Goodbye, my friend ..."}
          lappend pre_shutdown_commands {echo "see you soon !"}
     The commands in the list will be executed (in the same order they
     occupy in the list) before OpenOCD exits.  If one of the commands
     in the list fails, then the remaining commands are not executed
     anymore while OpenOCD will proceed to quit.

 -- Command: debug_level [n]
     Display debug level.  If N (from 0..4) is provided, then set it to
     that level.  This affects the kind of messages sent to the server
     log.  Level 0 is error messages only; level 1 adds warnings; level
     2 adds informational messages; level 3 adds debugging messages; and
     level 4 adds verbose low-level debug messages.  The default is
     level 2, but that can be overridden on the command line along with
     the location of that log file (which is normally the server's
     standard output).  *Note Running::.

 -- Command: echo [-n] message
     Logs a message at "user" priority.  Option "-n" suppresses trailing
     newline.
          echo "Downloading kernel -- please wait"

 -- Command: log_output [filename | "default"]
     Redirect logging to FILENAME or set it back to default output; the
     default log output channel is stderr.

 -- Command: add_script_search_dir [directory]
     Add DIRECTORY to the file/script search path.

 -- Config Command: bindto [NAME]
     Specify hostname or IPv4 address on which to listen for incoming
     TCP/IP connections.  By default, OpenOCD will listen on the
     loopback interface only.  If your network environment is safe,
     'bindto 0.0.0.0' can be used to cover all available interfaces.

15.2 Target State handling
==========================

In this section "target" refers to a CPU configured as shown earlier
(*note CPU Configuration::).  These commands, like many, implicitly
refer to a current target which is used to perform the various
operations.  The current target may be changed by using 'targets'
command with the name of the target which should become current.

 -- Command: reg [(number|name) [(value|'force')]]
     Access a single register by NUMBER or by its NAME.  The target must
     generally be halted before access to CPU core registers is allowed.
     Depending on the hardware, some other registers may be accessible
     while the target is running.

     _With no arguments_: list all available registers for the current
     target, showing number, name, size, value, and cache status.  For
     valid entries, a value is shown; valid entries which are also dirty
     (and will be written back later) are flagged as such.

     _With number/name_: display that register's value.  Use FORCE
     argument to read directly from the target, bypassing any internal
     cache.

     _With both number/name and value_: set register's value.  Writes
     may be held in a writeback cache internal to OpenOCD, so that
     setting the value marks the register as dirty instead of
     immediately flushing that value.  Resuming CPU execution (including
     by single stepping) or otherwise activating the relevant module
     will flush such values.

     Cores may have surprisingly many registers in their Debug and trace
     infrastructure:

          > reg
          ===== ARM registers
          (0) r0 (/32): 0x0000D3C2 (dirty)
          (1) r1 (/32): 0xFD61F31C
          (2) r2 (/32)
          ...
          (164) ETM_contextid_comparator_mask (/32)
          >

 -- Command: set_reg dict
     Set register values of the target.

        * DICT ...  Tcl dictionary with pairs of register names and
          values.

     For example, the following command sets the value 0 to the program
     counter (pc) register and 0x1000 to the stack pointer (sp)
     register:

          set_reg {pc 0 sp 0x1000}

 -- Command: get_reg [-force] list
     Get register values from the target and return them as Tcl
     dictionary with pairs of register names and values.  If option
     "-force" is set, the register values are read directly from the
     target, bypassing any caching.

        * LIST ...  List of register names

     For example, the following command retrieves the values from the
     program counter (pc) and stack pointer (sp) register:

          get_reg {pc sp}

 -- Command: write_memory address width data ['phys']
     This function provides an efficient way to write to the target
     memory from a Tcl script.

        * ADDRESS ...  target memory address
        * WIDTH ...  memory access bit size, can be 8, 16, 32 or 64
        * DATA ...  Tcl list with the elements to write
        * ['phys'] ...  treat the memory address as physical instead of
          virtual address

     For example, the following command writes two 32 bit words into the
     target memory at address 0x20000000:

          write_memory 0x20000000 32 {0xdeadbeef 0x00230500}

 -- Command: read_memory address width count ['phys']
     This function provides an efficient way to read the target memory
     from a Tcl script.  A Tcl list containing the requested memory
     elements is returned by this function.

        * ADDRESS ...  target memory address
        * WIDTH ...  memory access bit size, can be 8, 16, 32 or 64
        * COUNT ...  number of elements to read
        * ['phys'] ...  treat the memory address as physical instead of
          virtual address

     For example, the following command reads two 32 bit words from the
     target memory at address 0x20000000:

          read_memory 0x20000000 32 2

 -- Command: halt [ms]
 -- Command: wait_halt [ms]
     The 'halt' command first sends a halt request to the target, which
     'wait_halt' doesn't.  Otherwise these behave the same: wait up to
     MS milliseconds, or 5 seconds if there is no parameter, for the
     target to halt (and enter debug mode).  Using 0 as the MS parameter
     prevents OpenOCD from waiting.

          Warning: On ARM cores, software using the _wait for interrupt_
          operation often blocks the JTAG access needed by a 'halt'
          command.  This is because that operation also puts the core
          into a low power mode by gating the core clock; but the core
          clock is needed to detect JTAG clock transitions.

          One partial workaround uses adaptive clocking: when the core
          is interrupted the operation completes, then JTAG clocks are
          accepted at least until the interrupt handler completes.
          However, this workaround is often unusable since the
          processor, board, and JTAG adapter must all support adaptive
          JTAG clocking.  Also, it can't work until an interrupt is
          issued.

          A more complete workaround is to not use that operation while
          you work with a JTAG debugger.  Tasking environments generally
          have idle loops where the body is the _wait for interrupt_
          operation.  (On older cores, it is a coprocessor action; newer
          cores have a 'wfi' instruction.)  Such loops can just remove
          that operation, at the cost of higher power consumption
          (because the CPU is needlessly clocked).

 -- Command: resume [address]
     Resume the target at its current code position, or the optional
     ADDRESS if it is provided.  OpenOCD will wait 5 seconds for the
     target to resume.

 -- Command: step [address]
     Single-step the target at its current code position, or the
     optional ADDRESS if it is provided.

 -- Command: reset
 -- Command: reset run
 -- Command: reset halt
 -- Command: reset init
     Perform as hard a reset as possible, using SRST if possible.  _All
     defined targets will be reset, and target events will fire during
     the reset sequence._

     The optional parameter specifies what should happen after the
     reset.  If there is no parameter, a 'reset run' is executed.  The
     other options will not work on all systems.  *Note Reset
     Configuration::.

        - run Let the target run
        - halt Immediately halt the target
        - init Immediately halt the target, and execute the reset-init
          script

 -- Command: soft_reset_halt
     Requesting target halt and executing a soft reset.  This is often
     used when a target cannot be reset and halted.  The target, after
     reset is released begins to execute code.  OpenOCD attempts to stop
     the CPU and then sets the program counter back to the reset vector.
     Unfortunately the code that was executed may have left the hardware
     in an unknown state.

 -- Command: adapter assert [signal [assert|deassert signal]]
 -- Command: adapter deassert [signal [assert|deassert signal]]
     Set values of reset signals.  Without parameters returns current
     status of the signals.  The SIGNAL parameter values may be 'srst',
     indicating that srst signal is to be asserted or deasserted,
     'trst', indicating that trst signal is to be asserted or
     deasserted.

     The 'reset_config' command should already have been used to
     configure how the board and the adapter treat these two signals,
     and to say if either signal is even present.  *Note Reset
     Configuration::.  Trying to assert a signal that is not present
     triggers an error.  If a signal is present on the adapter and not
     specified in the command, the signal will not be modified.

          Note: TRST is specially handled.  It actually signifies JTAG's
          RESET state.  So if the board doesn't support the optional
          TRST signal, or it doesn't support it along with the specified
          SRST value, JTAG reset is triggered with TMS and TCK signals
          instead of the TRST signal.  And no matter how that JTAG reset
          is triggered, once the scan chain enters RESET with TRST
          inactive, TAP 'post-reset' events are delivered to all TAPs
          with handlers for that event.

15.3 Memory access commands
===========================

These commands allow accesses of a specific size to the memory system.
Often these are used to configure the current target in some special
way.  For example - one may need to write certain values to the SDRAM
controller to enable SDRAM.

  1. Use the 'targets' (plural) command to change the current target.
  2. In system level scripts these commands are deprecated.  Please use
     their TARGET object siblings to avoid making assumptions about what
     TAP is the current target, or about MMU configuration.

 -- Command: mdd [phys] addr [count]
 -- Command: mdw [phys] addr [count]
 -- Command: mdh [phys] addr [count]
 -- Command: mdb [phys] addr [count]
     Display contents of address ADDR, as 64-bit doublewords ('mdd'),
     32-bit words ('mdw'), 16-bit halfwords ('mdh'), or 8-bit bytes
     ('mdb').  When the current target has an MMU which is present and
     active, ADDR is interpreted as a virtual address.  Otherwise, or if
     the optional PHYS flag is specified, ADDR is interpreted as a
     physical address.  If COUNT is specified, displays that many units.
     (If you want to process the data instead of displaying it, see the
     'read_memory' primitives.)

 -- Command: mwd [phys] addr doubleword [count]
 -- Command: mww [phys] addr word [count]
 -- Command: mwh [phys] addr halfword [count]
 -- Command: mwb [phys] addr byte [count]
     Writes the specified DOUBLEWORD (64 bits), WORD (32 bits), HALFWORD
     (16 bits), or BYTE (8-bit) value, at the specified address ADDR.
     When the current target has an MMU which is present and active,
     ADDR is interpreted as a virtual address.  Otherwise, or if the
     optional PHYS flag is specified, ADDR is interpreted as a physical
     address.  If COUNT is specified, fills that many units of
     consecutive address.

15.4 Image loading commands
===========================

 -- Command: dump_image filename address size
     Dump SIZE bytes of target memory starting at ADDRESS to the binary
     file named FILENAME.

 -- Command: fast_load
     Loads an image stored in memory by 'fast_load_image' to the current
     target.  Must be preceded by fast_load_image.

 -- Command: fast_load_image filename address ['bin'|'ihex'|'elf'|'s19']
     Normally you should be using 'load_image' or GDB load.  However,
     for testing purposes or when I/O overhead is significant(OpenOCD
     running on an embedded host), storing the image in memory and
     uploading the image to the target can be a way to upload e.g.
     multiple debug sessions when the binary does not change.  Arguments
     are the same as 'load_image', but the image is stored in OpenOCD
     host memory, i.e.  does not affect target.  This approach is also
     useful when profiling target programming performance as I/O and
     target programming can easily be profiled separately.

 -- Command: load_image filename address [['bin'|'ihex'|'elf'|'s19']
          'min_addr' 'max_length']
     Load image from file FILENAME to target memory offset by ADDRESS
     from its load address.  The file format may optionally be specified
     ('bin', 'ihex', 'elf', or 's19').  In addition the following
     arguments may be specified: MIN_ADDR - ignore data below MIN_ADDR
     (this is w.r.t.  to the target's load address + ADDRESS) MAX_LENGTH
     - maximum number of bytes to load.
          proc load_image_bin {fname foffset address length } {
              # Load data from fname filename at foffset offset to
              # target at address. Load at most length bytes.
              load_image $fname [expr {$address - $foffset}] bin \
                         $address $length
          }

 -- Command: test_image filename [address ['bin'|'ihex'|'elf']]
     Displays image section sizes and addresses as if FILENAME were
     loaded into target memory starting at ADDRESS (defaults to zero).
     The file format may optionally be specified ('bin', 'ihex', or
     'elf')

 -- Command: verify_image filename address ['bin'|'ihex'|'elf']
     Verify FILENAME against target memory starting at ADDRESS.  The
     file format may optionally be specified ('bin', 'ihex', or 'elf')
     This will first attempt a comparison using a CRC checksum, if this
     fails it will try a binary compare.

 -- Command: verify_image_checksum filename address ['bin'|'ihex'|'elf']
     Verify FILENAME against target memory starting at ADDRESS.  The
     file format may optionally be specified ('bin', 'ihex', or 'elf')
     This perform a comparison using a CRC checksum only

15.5 Breakpoint and Watchpoint commands
=======================================

CPUs often make debug modules accessible through JTAG, with hardware
support for a handful of code breakpoints and data watchpoints.  In
addition, CPUs almost always support software breakpoints.

 -- Command: bp [address len ['hw']]
     With no parameters, lists all active breakpoints.  Else sets a
     breakpoint on code execution starting at ADDRESS for LENGTH bytes.
     This is a software breakpoint, unless 'hw' is specified in which
     case it will be a hardware breakpoint.

     (*Note arm9 vector_catch: arm9vectorcatch, or *note xscale
     vector_catch: xscalevectorcatch, for similar mechanisms that do not
     consume hardware breakpoints.)

 -- Command: rbp 'all' | address
     Remove the breakpoint at ADDRESS or all breakpoints.

 -- Command: rwp address
     Remove data watchpoint on ADDRESS

 -- Command: wp [address len [('r'|'w'|'a') [value [mask]]]]
     With no parameters, lists all active watchpoints.  Else sets a data
     watchpoint on data from ADDRESS for LENGTH bytes.  The watch point
     is an "access" watchpoint unless the 'r' or 'w' parameter is
     provided, defining it as respectively a read or write watchpoint.
     If a VALUE is provided, that value is used when determining if the
     watchpoint should trigger.  The value may be first be masked using
     MASK to mark "don't care" fields.

15.6 Real Time Transfer (RTT)
=============================

Real Time Transfer (RTT) is an interface specified by SEGGER based on
basic memory reads and writes to transfer data bidirectionally between
target and host.  The specification is independent of the target
architecture.  Every target that supports so called "background memory
access", which means that the target memory can be accessed by the
debugger while the target is running, can be used.  This interface is
especially of interest for targets without Serial Wire Output (SWO),
such as ARM Cortex-M0, or where semihosting is not applicable because of
real-time constraints.

     Note: The current implementation supports only single target
     devices.

The data transfer between host and target device is organized through
unidirectional up/down-channels for target-to-host and host-to-target
communication, respectively.

     Note: The current implementation does not respect channel buffer
     flags.  They are used to determine what happens when writing to a
     full buffer, for example.

Channels are exposed via raw TCP/IP connections.  One or more RTT
servers can be assigned to each channel to make them accessible to an
unlimited number of TCP/IP connections.

 -- Command: rtt setup address size ID
     Configure RTT for the currently selected target.  Once RTT is
     started, OpenOCD searches for a control block with the identifier
     ID starting at the memory address ADDRESS within the next SIZE
     bytes.

 -- Command: rtt start
     Start RTT. If the control block location is not known, OpenOCD
     starts searching for it.

 -- Command: rtt stop
     Stop RTT.

 -- Command: rtt polling_interval [interval]
     Display the polling interval.  If INTERVAL is provided, set the
     polling interval.  The polling interval determines (in
     milliseconds) how often the up-channels are checked for new data.

 -- Command: rtt channels
     Display a list of all channels and their properties.

 -- Command: rtt channellist
     Return a list of all channels and their properties as Tcl list.
     The list can be manipulated easily from within scripts.

 -- Command: rtt server start port channel
     Start a TCP server on PORT for the channel CHANNEL.

 -- Command: rtt server stop port
     Stop the TCP sever with port PORT.

The following example shows how to setup RTT using the SEGGER RTT
implementation on the target device.

     resume

     rtt setup 0x20000000 2048 "SEGGER RTT"
     rtt start

     rtt server start 9090 0

In this example, OpenOCD searches the control block with the ID "SEGGER
RTT" starting at 0x20000000 for 2048 bytes.  The RTT channel 0 is
exposed through the TCP/IP port 9090.

15.7 Misc Commands
==================

 -- Command: profile seconds filename [start end]
     Profiling samples the CPU's program counter as quickly as possible,
     which is useful for non-intrusive stochastic profiling.  Saves up
     to 10000 samples in 'filename' using "gmon.out" format.  Optional
     'start' and 'end' parameters allow to limit the address range.

 -- Command: version
     Displays a string identifying the version of this OpenOCD server.

 -- Command: virt2phys virtual_address
     Requests the current target to map the specified VIRTUAL_ADDRESS to
     its corresponding physical address, and displays the result.

 -- Command: add_help_text 'command_name' 'help-string'
     Add or replace help text on the given COMMAND_NAME.

 -- Command: add_usage_text 'command_name' 'help-string'
     Add or replace usage text on the given COMMAND_NAME.

16 Architecture and Core Commands
*********************************

Most CPUs have specialized JTAG operations to support debugging.
OpenOCD packages most such operations in its standard command framework.
Some of those operations don't fit well in that framework, so they are
exposed here as architecture or implementation (core) specific commands.

16.1 ARM Hardware Tracing
=========================

CPUs based on ARM cores may include standard tracing interfaces, based
on an "Embedded Trace Module" (ETM) which sends voluminous address and
data bus trace records to a "Trace Port".

   * Development-oriented boards will sometimes provide a high speed
     trace connector for collecting that data, when the particular CPU
     supports such an interface.  (The standard connector is a 38-pin
     Mictor, with both JTAG and trace port support.)  Those trace
     connectors are supported by higher end JTAG adapters and some logic
     analyzer modules; frequently those modules can buffer several
     megabytes of trace data.  Configuring an ETM coupled to such an
     external trace port belongs in the board-specific configuration
     file.
   * If the CPU doesn't provide an external interface, it probably has
     an "Embedded Trace Buffer" (ETB) on the chip, which is a dedicated
     SRAM. 4KBytes is one common ETB size.  Configuring an ETM coupled
     only to an ETB belongs in the CPU-specific (target) configuration
     file, since it works the same on all boards.

ETM support in OpenOCD doesn't seem to be widely used yet.

     Issues: ETM support may be buggy, and at least some 'etm config'
     parameters should be detected by asking the ETM for them.

     ETM trigger events could also implement a kind of complex hardware
     breakpoint, much more powerful than the simple watchpoint hardware
     exported by EmbeddedICE modules.  _Such breakpoints can be
     triggered even when using the dummy trace port driver_.

     It seems like a GDB hookup should be possible, as well as tracing
     only during specific states (perhaps _handling IRQ 23_ or _calls
     foo()_).

     There should be GUI tools to manipulate saved trace data and help
     analyse it in conjunction with the source code.  It's unclear how
     much of a common interface is shared with the current XScale trace
     support, or should be shared with eventual Nexus-style trace module
     support.

     At this writing (November 2009) only ARM7, ARM9, and ARM11 support
     for ETM modules is available.  The code should be able to work with
     some newer cores; but not all of them support this original style
     of JTAG access.

16.1.1 ETM Configuration
------------------------

ETM setup is coupled with the trace port driver configuration.

 -- Config Command: etm config target width mode clocking driver
     Declares the ETM associated with TARGET, and associates it with a
     given trace port DRIVER.  *Note Trace Port Drivers:
     traceportdrivers.

     Several of the parameters must reflect the trace port capabilities,
     which are a function of silicon capabilities (exposed later using
     'etm info') and of what hardware is connected to that port (such as
     an external pod, or ETB). The WIDTH must be either 4, 8, or 16,
     except with ETMv3.0 and newer modules which may also support 1, 2,
     24, 32, 48, and 64 bit widths.  (With those versions, 'etm info'
     also shows whether the selected port width and mode are supported.)

     The MODE must be 'normal', 'multiplexed', or 'demultiplexed'.  The
     CLOCKING must be 'half' or 'full'.

          Warning: With ETMv3.0 and newer, the bits set with the MODE
          and CLOCKING parameters both control the mode.  This modified
          mode does not map to the values supported by previous ETM
          modules, so this syntax is subject to change.

          Note: You can see the ETM registers using the 'reg' command.
          Not all possible registers are present in every ETM. Most of
          the registers are write-only, and are used to configure what
          CPU activities are traced.

 -- Command: etm info
     Displays information about the current target's ETM. This includes
     resource counts from the 'ETM_CONFIG' register, as well as silicon
     capabilities (except on rather old modules).  from the
     'ETM_SYS_CONFIG' register.

 -- Command: etm status
     Displays status of the current target's ETM and trace port driver:
     is the ETM idle, or is it collecting data?  Did trace data
     overflow?  Was it triggered?

 -- Command: etm tracemode [type context_id_bits cycle_accurate
          branch_output]
     Displays what data that ETM will collect.  If arguments are
     provided, first configures that data.  When the configuration
     changes, tracing is stopped and any buffered trace data is
     invalidated.

        * TYPE ...  describing how data accesses are traced, when they
          pass any ViewData filtering that was set up.  The value is one
          of 'none' (save nothing), 'data' (save data), 'address' (save
          addresses), 'all' (save data and addresses)
        * CONTEXT_ID_BITS ...  0, 8, 16, or 32
        * CYCLE_ACCURATE ...  'enable' or 'disable' cycle-accurate
          instruction tracing.  Before ETMv3, enabling this causes much
          extra data to be recorded.
        * BRANCH_OUTPUT ...  'enable' or 'disable'.  Disable this unless
          you need to try reconstructing the instruction trace stream
          without an image of the code.

 -- Command: etm trigger_debug ('enable'|'disable')
     Displays whether ETM triggering debug entry (like a breakpoint) is
     enabled or disabled, after optionally modifying that configuration.
     The default behaviour is 'disable'.  Any change takes effect after
     the next 'etm start'.

     By using script commands to configure ETM registers, you can make
     the processor enter debug state automatically when certain
     conditions, more complex than supported by the breakpoint hardware,
     happen.

16.1.2 ETM Trace Operation
--------------------------

After setting up the ETM, you can use it to collect data.  That data can
be exported to files for later analysis.  It can also be parsed with
OpenOCD, for basic sanity checking.

To configure what is being traced, you will need to write various trace
registers using 'reg ETM_*' commands.  For the definitions of these
registers, read ARM publication _IHI 0014, "Embedded Trace Macrocell,
Architecture Specification"_.  Be aware that most of the relevant
registers are write-only, and that ETM resources are limited.  There are
only a handful of address comparators, data comparators, counters, and
so on.

Examples of scenarios you might arrange to trace include:

   * Code flow within a function, _excluding_ subroutines it calls.  Use
     address range comparators to enable tracing for instruction access
     within that function's body.
   * Code flow within a function, _including_ subroutines it calls.  Use
     the sequencer and address comparators to activate tracing on an
     "entered function" state, then deactivate it by exiting that state
     when the function's exit code is invoked.
   * Code flow starting at the fifth invocation of a function, combining
     one of the above models with a counter.
   * CPU data accesses to the registers for a particular device, using
     address range comparators and the ViewData logic.
   * Such data accesses only during IRQ handling, combining the above
     model with sequencer triggers which on entry and exit to the IRQ
     handler.
   * _...  more_

At this writing, September 2009, there are no Tcl utility procedures to
help set up any common tracing scenarios.

 -- Command: etm analyze
     Reads trace data into memory, if it wasn't already present.
     Decodes and prints the data that was collected.

 -- Command: etm dump filename
     Stores the captured trace data in 'filename'.

 -- Command: etm image filename [base_address] [type]
     Opens an image file.

 -- Command: etm load filename
     Loads captured trace data from 'filename'.

 -- Command: etm start
     Starts trace data collection.

 -- Command: etm stop
     Stops trace data collection.

16.1.3 Trace Port Drivers
-------------------------

To use an ETM trace port it must be associated with a driver.

 -- Trace Port Driver: dummy
     Use the 'dummy' driver if you are configuring an ETM that's not
     connected to anything (on-chip ETB or off-chip trace connector).
     _This driver lets OpenOCD talk to the ETM, but it does not expose
     any trace data collection._
      -- Config Command: etm_dummy config target
          Associates the ETM for TARGET with a dummy driver.

 -- Trace Port Driver: etb
     Use the 'etb' driver if you are configuring an ETM to use on-chip
     ETB memory.
      -- Config Command: etb config target etb_tap
          Associates the ETM for TARGET with the ETB at ETB_TAP.  You
          can see the ETB registers using the 'reg' command.
      -- Command: etb trigger_percent [percent]
          This displays, or optionally changes, ETB behavior after the
          ETM's configured _trigger_ event fires.  It controls how much
          more trace data is saved after the (single) trace trigger
          becomes active.

             * The default corresponds to _trace around_ usage,
               recording 50 percent data before the event and the rest
               afterwards.
             * The minimum value of PERCENT is 2 percent, recording
               almost exclusively data before the trigger.  Such extreme
               _trace before_ usage can help figure out what caused that
               event to happen.
             * The maximum value of PERCENT is 100 percent, recording
               data almost exclusively after the event.  This extreme
               _trace after_ usage might help sort out how the event
               caused trouble.

16.2 ARM Cross-Trigger Interface
================================

The ARM Cross-Trigger Interface (CTI) is a generic CoreSight component
that connects event sources like tracing components or CPU cores with
each other through a common trigger matrix (CTM). For ARMv8
architecture, a CTI is mandatory for core run control and each core has
an individual CTI instance attached to it.  OpenOCD has limited support
for CTI using the _cti_ group of commands.

 -- Command: cti create cti_name '-dap' dap_name '-ap-num' apn
          '-baseaddr' base_address
     Creates a CTI instance CTI_NAME on the DAP instance DAP_NAME on
     MEM-AP APN.  On ADIv5 DAP APN is the numeric index of the DAP AP
     the CTI is connected to.  On ADIv6 DAP APN is the base address of
     the DAP AP the CTI is connected to.  The BASE_ADDRESS must match
     the base address of the CTI on the respective MEM-AP. All arguments
     are mandatory.  This creates a new command '$cti_name' which is
     used for various purposes including additional configuration.

 -- Command: $cti_name enable 'on|off'
     Enable ('on') or disable ('off') the CTI.

 -- Command: $cti_name dump
     Displays a register dump of the CTI.

 -- Command: $cti_name write REG_NAME VALUE
     Write VALUE to the CTI register with the symbolic name REG_NAME.

 -- Command: $cti_name read REG_NAME
     Print the value read from the CTI register with the symbolic name
     REG_NAME.

 -- Command: $cti_name ack EVENT
     Acknowledge a CTI EVENT.

 -- Command: $cti_name channel CHANNEL_NUMBER OPERATION
     Perform a specific channel operation, the possible operations are:
     gate, ungate, set, clear and pulse

 -- Command: $cti_name testmode 'on|off'
     Enable ('on') or disable ('off') the integration test mode of the
     CTI.

 -- Command: cti names
     Prints a list of names of all CTI objects created.  This command is
     mainly useful in TCL scripting.

16.3 Generic ARM
================

These commands should be available on all ARM processors.  They are
available in addition to other core-specific commands that may be
available.

 -- Command: arm core_state ['arm'|'thumb']
     Displays the core_state, optionally changing it to process either
     'arm' or 'thumb' instructions.  The target may later be resumed in
     the currently set core_state.  (Processors may also support the
     Jazelle state, but that is not currently supported in OpenOCD.)

 -- Command: arm disassemble address [count ['thumb']]
     Disassembles COUNT instructions starting at ADDRESS.  If COUNT is
     not specified, a single instruction is disassembled.  If 'thumb' is
     specified, or the low bit of the address is set, Thumb2 (mixed
     16/32-bit) instructions are used; else ARM (32-bit) instructions
     are used.  (Processors may also support the Jazelle state, but
     those instructions are not currently understood by OpenOCD.)

     Note that all Thumb instructions are Thumb2 instructions, so older
     processors (without Thumb2 support) will still see correct
     disassembly of Thumb code.  Also, ThumbEE opcodes are the same as
     Thumb2, with a handful of exceptions.  ThumbEE disassembly
     currently has no explicit support.

 -- Command: arm mcr pX op1 CRn CRm op2 value
     Write VALUE to a coprocessor PX register passing parameters CRN,
     CRM, opcodes OPC1 and OPC2, and using the MCR instruction.
     (Parameter sequence matches the ARM instruction, but omits an ARM
     register.)

 -- Command: arm mrc pX coproc op1 CRn CRm op2
     Read a coprocessor PX register passing parameters CRN, CRM, opcodes
     OPC1 and OPC2, and the MRC instruction.  Returns the result so it
     can be manipulated by Jim scripts.  (Parameter sequence matches the
     ARM instruction, but omits an ARM register.)

 -- Command: arm reg
     Display a table of all banked core registers, fetching the current
     value from every core mode if necessary.

 -- Command: arm semihosting ['enable'|'disable']
     Display status of semihosting, after optionally changing that
     status.

     Semihosting allows for code executing on an ARM target to use the
     I/O facilities on the host computer i.e.  the system where OpenOCD
     is running.  The target application must be linked against a
     library implementing the ARM semihosting convention that forwards
     operation requests by using a special SVC instruction that is
     trapped at the Supervisor Call vector by OpenOCD.

 -- Command: arm semihosting_redirect ('disable' | 'tcp' <port>
     ['debug'|'stdio'|'all') Redirect semihosting messages to a
     specified TCP port.

     This command redirects debug (READC, WRITEC and WRITE0) and stdio
     (READ, WRITE) semihosting operations to the specified TCP port.
     The command allows to select which type of operations to redirect
     (debug, stdio, all (default)).  Note: for stdio operations, only
     I/O from/to ':tt' file descriptors are redirected.

 -- Command: arm semihosting_cmdline ['enable'|'disable']
     Set the command line to be passed to the debugger.

          arm semihosting_cmdline argv0 argv1 argv2 ...

     This option lets one set the command line arguments to be passed to
     the program.  The first argument (argv0) is the program name in a
     standard C environment (argv[0]).  Depending on the program (not
     much programs look at argv[0]), argv0 is ignored and can be any
     string.

 -- Command: arm semihosting_fileio ['enable'|'disable']
     Display status of semihosting fileio, after optionally changing
     that status.

     Enabling this option forwards semihosting I/O to GDB process using
     the File-I/O remote protocol extension.  This is especially useful
     for interacting with remote files or displaying console messages in
     the debugger.

 -- Command: arm semihosting_resexit ['enable'|'disable']
     Enable resumable SEMIHOSTING_SYS_EXIT.

     When SEMIHOSTING_SYS_EXIT is called outside a debug session, things
     are simple, the openocd process calls exit() and passes the value
     returned by the target.

     When SEMIHOSTING_SYS_EXIT is called during a debug session, by
     default execution returns to the debugger, leaving the debugger in
     a HALT state, similar to the state entered when encountering a
     break.

     In some use cases, it is useful to have SEMIHOSTING_SYS_EXIT return
     normally, as any semihosting call, and do not break to the
     debugger.  The standard allows this to happen, but the condition to
     trigger it is a bit obscure ("by performing an RDI_Execute request
     or equivalent").

     To make the SEMIHOSTING_SYS_EXIT call return normally, enable this
     option (default: disabled).

 -- Command: arm semihosting_read_user_param
     Read parameter of the semihosting call from the target.  Usable in
     semihosting-user-cmd-0x10* event handlers, returning a string.

     When the target makes semihosting call with operation number from
     range 0x100- 0x107, an optional string parameter can be passed to
     the server.  This parameter is valid during the run of the event
     handlers and is accessible with this command.

 -- Command: arm semihosting_basedir [dir]
     Set the base directory for semihosting I/O, either an absolute path
     or a path relative to OpenOCD working directory.  Use "."  for the
     current directory.

16.4 ARMv4 and ARMv5 Architecture
=================================

The ARMv4 and ARMv5 architectures are widely used in embedded systems,
and introduced core parts of the instruction set in use today.  That
includes the Thumb instruction set, introduced in the ARMv4T variant.

16.4.1 ARM7 and ARM9 specific commands
--------------------------------------

These commands are specific to ARM7 and ARM9 cores, like ARM7TDMI,
ARM720T, ARM9TDMI, ARM920T or ARM926EJ-S. They are available in addition
to the ARM commands, and any other core-specific commands that may be
available.

 -- Command: arm7_9 dbgrq ['enable'|'disable']
     Displays the value of the flag controlling use of the EmbeddedIce
     DBGRQ signal to force entry into debug mode, instead of
     breakpoints.  If a boolean parameter is provided, first assigns
     that flag.

     This should be safe for all but ARM7TDMI-S cores (like NXP LPC).
     This feature is enabled by default on most ARM9 cores, including
     ARM9TDMI, ARM920T, and ARM926EJ-S.

 -- Command: arm7_9 dcc_downloads ['enable'|'disable']
     Displays the value of the flag controlling use of the debug
     communications channel (DCC) to write larger (>128 byte) amounts of
     memory.  If a boolean parameter is provided, first assigns that
     flag.

     DCC downloads offer a huge speed increase, but might be unsafe,
     especially with targets running at very low speeds.  This command
     was introduced with OpenOCD rev.  60, and requires a few bytes of
     working area.

 -- Command: arm7_9 fast_memory_access ['enable'|'disable']
     Displays the value of the flag controlling use of memory writes and
     reads that don't check completion of the operation.  If a boolean
     parameter is provided, first assigns that flag.

     This provides a huge speed increase, especially with USB JTAG
     cables (FT2232), but might be unsafe if used with targets running
     at very low speeds, like the 32kHz startup clock of an AT91RM9200.

16.4.2 ARM9 specific commands
-----------------------------

ARM9-family cores are built around ARM9TDMI or ARM9E (including ARM9EJS)
integer processors.  Such cores include the ARM920T, ARM926EJ-S, and
ARM966.

 -- Command: arm9 vector_catch ['all'|'none'|list]
     Vector Catch hardware provides a sort of dedicated breakpoint for
     hardware events such as reset, interrupt, and abort.  You can use
     this to conserve normal breakpoint resources, so long as you're not
     concerned with code that branches directly to those hardware
     vectors.

     This always finishes by listing the current configuration.  If
     parameters are provided, it first reconfigures the vector catch
     hardware to intercept 'all' of the hardware vectors, 'none' of
     them, or a list with one or more of the following: 'reset' 'undef'
     'swi' 'pabt' 'dabt' 'irq' 'fiq'.

16.4.3 ARM920T specific commands
--------------------------------

These commands are available to ARM920T based CPUs, which are
implementations of the ARMv4T architecture built using the ARM9TDMI
integer core.  They are available in addition to the ARM, ARM7/ARM9, and
ARM9 commands.

 -- Command: arm920t cache_info
     Print information about the caches found.  This allows to see
     whether your target is an ARM920T (2x16kByte cache) or ARM922T
     (2x8kByte cache).

 -- Command: arm920t cp15 regnum [value]
     Display cp15 register REGNUM; else if a VALUE is provided, that
     value is written to that register.  This uses "physical access" and
     the register number is as shown in bits 38..33 of table 9-9 in the
     ARM920T TRM. (Not all registers can be written.)

 -- Command: arm920t read_cache filename
     Dump the content of ICache and DCache to a file named 'filename'.

 -- Command: arm920t read_mmu filename
     Dump the content of the ITLB and DTLB to a file named 'filename'.

16.4.4 ARM926ej-s specific commands
-----------------------------------

These commands are available to ARM926ej-s based CPUs, which are
implementations of the ARMv5TEJ architecture based on the ARM9EJ-S
integer core.  They are available in addition to the ARM, ARM7/ARM9, and
ARM9 commands.

The Feroceon cores also support these commands, although they are not
built from ARM926ej-s designs.

 -- Command: arm926ejs cache_info
     Print information about the caches found.

16.4.5 ARM966E specific commands
--------------------------------

These commands are available to ARM966 based CPUs, which are
implementations of the ARMv5TE architecture.  They are available in
addition to the ARM, ARM7/ARM9, and ARM9 commands.

 -- Command: arm966e cp15 regnum [value]
     Display cp15 register REGNUM; else if a VALUE is provided, that
     value is written to that register.  The six bit REGNUM values are
     bits 37..32 from table 7-2 of the ARM966E-S TRM. There is no
     current control over bits 31..30 from that table, as required for
     BIST support.

16.4.6 XScale specific commands
-------------------------------

Some notes about the debug implementation on the XScale CPUs:

The XScale CPU provides a special debug-only mini-instruction cache
(mini-IC) in which exception vectors and target-resident debug handler
code are placed by OpenOCD. In order to get access to the CPU, OpenOCD
must point vector 0 (the reset vector) to the entry of the debug
handler.  However, this means that the complete first cacheline in the
mini-IC is marked valid, which makes the CPU fetch all exception
handlers from the mini-IC, ignoring the code in RAM.

To address this situation, OpenOCD provides the 'xscale vector_table'
command, which allows the user to explicitly write individual entries to
either the high or low vector table stored in the mini-IC.

It is recommended to place a pc-relative indirect branch in the vector
table, and put the branch destination somewhere in memory.  Doing so
makes sure the code in the vector table stays constant regardless of
code layout in memory:
     _vectors:
             ldr     pc,[pc,#0x100-8]
             ldr     pc,[pc,#0x100-8]
             ldr     pc,[pc,#0x100-8]
             ldr     pc,[pc,#0x100-8]
             ldr     pc,[pc,#0x100-8]
             ldr     pc,[pc,#0x100-8]
             ldr     pc,[pc,#0x100-8]
             ldr     pc,[pc,#0x100-8]
             .org 0x100
             .long real_reset_vector
             .long real_ui_handler
             .long real_swi_handler
             .long real_pf_abort
             .long real_data_abort
             .long 0 /* unused */
             .long real_irq_handler
             .long real_fiq_handler

Alternatively, you may choose to keep some or all of the mini-IC vector
table entries synced with those written to memory by your system
software.  The mini-IC can not be modified while the processor is
executing, but for each vector table entry not previously defined using
the 'xscale vector_table' command, OpenOCD will copy the value from
memory to the mini-IC every time execution resumes from a halt.  This is
done for both high and low vector tables (although the table not in use
may not be mapped to valid memory, and in this case that copy operation
will silently fail).  This means that you will need to briefly halt
execution at some strategic point during system start-up; e.g., after
the software has initialized the vector table, but before exceptions are
enabled.  A breakpoint can be used to accomplish this once the
appropriate location in the start-up code has been identified.  A
watchpoint over the vector table region is helpful in finding the
location if you're not sure.  Note that the same situation exists any
time the vector table is modified by the system software.

The debug handler must be placed somewhere in the address space using
the 'xscale debug_handler' command.  The allowed locations for the debug
handler are either (0x800 - 0x1fef800) or (0xfe000800 - 0xfffff800).
The default value is 0xfe000800.

XScale has resources to support two hardware breakpoints and two
watchpoints.  However, the following restrictions on watchpoint
functionality apply: (1) the value and mask arguments to the 'wp'
command are not supported, (2) the watchpoint length must be a power of
two and not less than four, and can not be greater than the watchpoint
address, and (3) a watchpoint with a length greater than four consumes
all the watchpoint hardware resources.  This means that at any one time,
you can have enabled either two watchpoints with a length of four, or
one watchpoint with a length greater than four.

These commands are available to XScale based CPUs, which are
implementations of the ARMv5TE architecture.

 -- Command: xscale analyze_trace
     Displays the contents of the trace buffer.

 -- Command: xscale cache_clean_address address
     Changes the address used when cleaning the data cache.

 -- Command: xscale cache_info
     Displays information about the CPU caches.

 -- Command: xscale cp15 regnum [value]
     Display cp15 register REGNUM; else if a VALUE is provided, that
     value is written to that register.

 -- Command: xscale debug_handler target address
     Changes the address used for the specified target's debug handler.

 -- Command: xscale dcache ['enable'|'disable']
     Enables or disable the CPU's data cache.

 -- Command: xscale dump_trace filename
     Dumps the raw contents of the trace buffer to 'filename'.

 -- Command: xscale icache ['enable'|'disable']
     Enables or disable the CPU's instruction cache.

 -- Command: xscale mmu ['enable'|'disable']
     Enables or disable the CPU's memory management unit.

 -- Command: xscale trace_buffer ['enable'|'disable' ['fill' [n] |
          'wrap']]
     Displays the trace buffer status, after optionally enabling or
     disabling the trace buffer and modifying how it is emptied.

 -- Command: xscale trace_image filename [offset [type]]
     Opens a trace image from 'filename', optionally rebasing its
     segment addresses by OFFSET.  The image TYPE may be one of 'bin'
     (binary), 'ihex' (Intel hex), 'elf' (ELF file), 's19' (Motorola
     s19), 'mem', or 'builder'.

 -- Command: xscale vector_catch [mask]
     Display a bitmask showing the hardware vectors to catch.  If the
     optional parameter is provided, first set the bitmask to that
     value.

     The mask bits correspond with bit 16..23 in the DCSR:
          0x01    Trap Reset
          0x02    Trap Undefined Instructions
          0x04    Trap Software Interrupt
          0x08    Trap Prefetch Abort
          0x10    Trap Data Abort
          0x20    reserved
          0x40    Trap IRQ
          0x80    Trap FIQ

 -- Command: xscale vector_table [('low'|'high') index value]

     Set an entry in the mini-IC vector table.  There are two tables:
     one for low vectors (at 0x00000000), and one for high vectors
     (0xFFFF0000), each holding the 8 exception vectors.  INDEX can be
     1-7, because vector 0 points to the debug handler entry and can not
     be overwritten.  VALUE holds the 32-bit opcode that is placed in
     the mini-IC.

     Without arguments, the current settings are displayed.

16.5 ARMv6 Architecture
=======================

16.5.1 ARM11 specific commands
------------------------------

 -- Command: arm11 memwrite burst ['enable'|'disable']
     Displays the value of the memwrite burst-enable flag, which is
     enabled by default.  If a boolean parameter is provided, first
     assigns that flag.  Burst writes are only used for memory writes
     larger than 1 word.  They improve performance by assuming that the
     CPU has read each data word over JTAG and completed its write
     before the next word arrives, instead of polling for a status flag
     to verify that completion.  This is usually safe, because JTAG runs
     much slower than the CPU.

 -- Command: arm11 memwrite error_fatal ['enable'|'disable']
     Displays the value of the memwrite error_fatal flag, which is
     enabled by default.  If a boolean parameter is provided, first
     assigns that flag.  When set, certain memory write errors cause
     earlier transfer termination.

 -- Command: arm11 step_irq_enable ['enable'|'disable']
     Displays the value of the flag controlling whether IRQs are enabled
     during single stepping; they are disabled by default.  If a boolean
     parameter is provided, first assigns that.

 -- Command: arm11 vcr [value]
     Displays the value of the _Vector Catch Register (VCR)_,
     coprocessor 14 register 7.  If VALUE is defined, first assigns
     that.

     Vector Catch hardware provides dedicated breakpoints for certain
     hardware events.  The specific bit values are core-specific (as in
     fact is using coprocessor 14 register 7 itself) but all current
     ARM11 cores _except the ARM1176_ use the same six bits.

16.6 ARMv7 and ARMv8 Architecture
=================================

16.6.1 ARMv7-A specific commands
--------------------------------

 -- Command: cortex_a cache_info
     display information about target caches

 -- Command: cortex_a dacrfixup ['on'|'off']
     Work around issues with software breakpoints when the program text
     is mapped read-only by the operating system.  This option sets the
     CP15 DACR to "all-manager" to bypass MMU permission checks on
     memory access.  Defaults to 'off'.

 -- Command: cortex_a dbginit
     Initialize core debug Enables debug by unlocking the Software Lock
     and clearing sticky powerdown indications

 -- Command: cortex_a smp [on|off]
     Display/set the current SMP mode

 -- Command: cortex_a smp_gdb [core_id]
     Display/set the current core displayed in GDB

 -- Command: cortex_a maskisr ['on'|'off']
     Selects whether interrupts will be processed when single stepping

 -- Command: cache_config l2x [base way]
     configure l2x cache

 -- Command: cortex_a mmu dump ['0'|'1'|'addr' address ['num_entries']]
     Dump the MMU translation table from TTB0 or TTB1 register, or from
     physical memory location ADDRESS.  When dumping the table from
     ADDRESS, print at most NUM_ENTRIES page table entries.  NUM_ENTRIES
     is optional, if omitted, the maximum possible (4096) entries are
     printed.

16.6.2 ARMv7-R specific commands
--------------------------------

 -- Command: cortex_r4 dbginit
     Initialize core debug Enables debug by unlocking the Software Lock
     and clearing sticky powerdown indications

 -- Command: cortex_r4 maskisr ['on'|'off']
     Selects whether interrupts will be processed when single stepping

16.6.3 ARM CoreSight TPIU and SWO specific commands
---------------------------------------------------

ARM CoreSight provides several modules to generate debugging information
internally (ITM, DWT and ETM). Their output is directed through TPIU or
SWO modules to be captured externally either on an SWO pin (this
configuration is called SWV) or on a synchronous parallel trace port.

ARM CoreSight provides independent HW blocks named TPIU and SWO each
with its own functionality.  Embedded in Cortex-M3 and M4, ARM provides
an optional HW block that includes both TPIU and SWO functionalities and
is again named TPIU, which causes quite some confusion.  The registers
map of all the TPIU and SWO implementations allows using a single driver
that detects at runtime the features available.

The 'tpiu' is used for either TPIU or SWO. A convenient alias 'swo' is
available to help distinguish, in scripts, the commands for SWO from the
commands for TPIU.

 -- Command: swo ...
     Alias of 'tpiu ...'.  Can be used in scripts to distinguish the
     commands for SWO from the commands for TPIU.

 -- Command: tpiu create tpiu_name configparams...
     Creates a TPIU or a SWO object.  The two commands are equivalent.
     Add the object in a list and add new commands ('TPIU_NAME') which
     are used for various purposes including additional configuration.

        * TPIU_NAME - the name of the TPIU or SWO object.  This name is
          also used to create the object's command, referred to here as
          '$tpiu_name', and in other places where the TPIU or SWO needs
          to be identified.
        * CONFIGPARAMS - all parameters accepted by '$tpiu_name
          configure' are permitted.

          You _must_ set here the AP and MEM_AP base_address through
          '-dap DAP_NAME', '-ap-num AP_NUMBER' and '-baseaddr
          BASE_ADDRESS'.

 -- Command: tpiu names
     Lists all the TPIU or SWO objects created so far.  The two commands
     are equivalent.

 -- Command: tpiu init
     Initialize all registered TPIU and SWO. The two commands are
     equivalent.  These commands are used internally during
     initialization.  They can be issued at any time after the
     initialization, too.

 -- Command: $tpiu_name cget queryparm
     Each configuration parameter accepted by '$tpiu_name configure' can
     be individually queried, to return its current value.  The
     QUERYPARM is a parameter name accepted by that command, such as
     '-dap'.

 -- Command: $tpiu_name configure configparams...
     The options accepted by this command may also be specified as
     parameters to 'tpiu create'.  Their values can later be queried one
     at a time by using the '$tpiu_name cget' command.

        * '-dap' DAP_NAME - names the DAP used to access this TPIU.
          *Note DAP declaration: dapdeclaration, on how to create and
          manage DAP instances.

        * '-ap-num' AP_NUMBER - sets DAP access port for TPIU. On ADIv5
          DAP AP_NUMBER is the numeric index of the DAP AP the TPIU is
          connected to.  On ADIv6 DAP AP_NUMBER is the base address of
          the DAP AP the TPIU is connected to.

        * '-baseaddr' BASE_ADDRESS - sets the TPIU BASE_ADDRESS where to
          access the TPIU in the DAP AP memory space.

        * '-protocol' ('sync'|'uart'|'manchester') - sets the protocol
          used for trace data:
             - 'sync' - synchronous parallel trace output mode, using
               PORT_WIDTH data bits (default);
             - 'uart' - use asynchronous SWO mode with NRZ (same as
               regular UART 8N1) coding;
             - 'manchester' - use asynchronous SWO mode with Manchester
               coding.

        * '-event' EVENT_NAME EVENT_BODY - assigns an event handler, a
          TCL string which is evaluated when the event is triggered.
          The events 'pre-enable', 'post-enable', 'pre-disable' and
          'post-disable' are defined for TPIU/SWO. A typical use case
          for the event 'pre-enable' is to enable the trace clock of the
          TPIU.

        * '-output' ('external'|':'PORT|FILENAME|'-') - specifies the
          destination of the trace data:
             - 'external' - configure TPIU/SWO to let user capture trace
               output externally, either with an additional UART or with
               a logic analyzer (default);
             - '-' - configure TPIU/SWO and debug adapter to gather
               trace data and forward it to 'tcl_trace' command;
             - ':'PORT - configure TPIU/SWO and debug adapter to gather
               trace data, open a TCP server at port PORT and send the
               trace data to each connected client;
             - FILENAME - configure TPIU/SWO and debug adapter to gather
               trace data and append it to FILENAME, which can be either
               a regular file or a named pipe.

        * '-traceclk' TRACECLKIN_FREQ - mandatory parameter.  Specifies
          the frequency in Hz of the trace clock.  For the TPIU embedded
          in Cortex-M3 or M4, this is usually the same frequency as
          HCLK. For protocol 'sync' this is twice the frequency of the
          pin data rate.

        * '-pin-freq' TRACE_FREQ - specifies the expected data rate in
          Hz of the SWO pin.  Parameter used only on protocols 'uart'
          and 'manchester'.  Can be omitted to let the adapter driver
          select the maximum supported rate automatically.

        * '-port-width' PORT_WIDTH - sets to PORT_WIDTH the width of the
          synchronous parallel port used for trace output.  Parameter
          used only on protocol 'sync'.  If not specified, default value
          is 1.

        * '-formatter' ('0'|'1') - specifies if the formatter should be
          enabled.  Parameter used only on protocol 'sync'.  If not
          specified, default value is 0.

 -- Command: $tpiu_name enable
     Uses the parameters specified by the previous '$tpiu_name
     configure' to configure and enable the TPIU or the SWO. If
     required, the adapter is also configured and enabled to receive the
     trace data.  This command can be used before 'init', but it will
     take effect only after the 'init'.

 -- Command: $tpiu_name disable
     Disable the TPIU or the SWO, terminating the receiving of the trace
     data.

Example usage:
  1. STM32L152 board is programmed with an application that configures
     PLL to provide core clock with 24MHz frequency; to use ITM output
     it's enough to:
          #include <libopencm3/cm3/itm.h>
              ...
              	ITM_STIM8(0) = c;
              ...
     (the most obvious way is to use the first stimulus port for printf,
     for that this ITM_STIM8 assignment can be used inside _write(); to
     make it blocking to avoid data loss, add 'while (!(ITM_STIM8(0) &
     ITM_STIM_FIFOREADY));');
  2. An FT2232H UART is connected to the SWO pin of the board;
  3. Commands to configure UART for 12MHz baud rate:
          $ setserial /dev/ttyUSB1 spd_cust divisor 5
          $ stty -F /dev/ttyUSB1 38400
     (FT2232H's base frequency is 60MHz, spd_cust allows to alias 38400
     baud with our custom divisor to get 12MHz)
  4. 'itmdump -f /dev/ttyUSB1 -d1'
  5. OpenOCD invocation line:
          openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg \
          -c "transport select hla_swd" \
          -f target/stm32l1.cfg \
          -c "stm32l1.tpiu configure -protocol uart" \
          -c "stm32l1.tpiu configure -traceclk 24000000 -pin-freq 12000000" \
          -c "stm32l1.tpiu enable"

16.6.4 ARMv7-M specific commands
--------------------------------

 -- Command: itm port PORT ('0'|'1'|'on'|'off')
     Enable or disable trace output for ITM stimulus PORT (counting from
     0).  Port 0 is enabled on target creation automatically.

 -- Command: itm ports ('0'|'1'|'on'|'off')
     Enable or disable trace output for all ITM stimulus ports.

16.6.5 Cortex-M specific commands
---------------------------------

 -- Command: cortex_m maskisr ('auto'|'on'|'off'|'steponly')
     Control masking (disabling) interrupts during target step/resume.

     The 'auto' option handles interrupts during stepping in a way that
     they get served but don't disturb the program flow.  The step
     command first allows pending interrupt handlers to execute, then
     disables interrupts and steps over the next instruction where the
     core was halted.  After the step interrupts are enabled again.  If
     the interrupt handlers don't complete within 500ms, the step
     command leaves with the core running.

     The 'steponly' option disables interrupts during single-stepping
     but enables them during normal execution.  This can be used as a
     partial workaround for 702596 erratum in Cortex-M7 r0p1.  See
     "Cortex-M7 (AT610) and Cortex-M7 with FPU (AT611) Software
     Developer Errata Notice" from ARM for further details.

     Note that a free hardware (FPB) breakpoint is required for the
     'auto' option.  If no breakpoint is available at the time of the
     step, then the step is taken with interrupts enabled, i.e.  the
     same way the 'off' option does.

     Default is 'auto'.

 -- Command: cortex_m vector_catch ['all'|'none'|list]
     Vector Catch hardware provides dedicated breakpoints for certain
     hardware events.

     Parameters request interception of 'all' of these hardware event
     vectors, 'none' of them, or one or more of the following:
     'hard_err' for a HardFault exception; 'mm_err' for a MemManage
     exception; 'bus_err' for a BusFault exception; 'irq_err',
     'state_err', 'chk_err', or 'nocp_err' for various UsageFault
     exceptions; or 'reset'.  If NVIC setup code does not enable them,
     MemManage, BusFault, and UsageFault exceptions are mapped to
     HardFault.  UsageFault checks for divide-by-zero and unaligned
     access must also be explicitly enabled.

     This finishes by listing the current vector catch configuration.

 -- Command: cortex_m reset_config ('sysresetreq'|'vectreset')
     Control reset handling if hardware srst is not fitted *Note
     reset_config: reset_config.

        - 'sysresetreq' use AIRCR SYSRESETREQ to reset system.
        - 'vectreset' use AIRCR VECTRESET to reset system (default).

     Using 'vectreset' is a safe option for Cortex-M3, M4 and M7 cores.
     This however has the disadvantage of only resetting the core, all
     peripherals are unaffected.  A solution would be to use a
     'reset-init' event handler to manually reset the peripherals.
     *Note Target Events: targetevents.

     Cortex-M0, M0+ and M1 do not support 'vectreset', use 'sysresetreq'
     instead.

16.6.6 ARMv8-A specific commands
--------------------------------

 -- Command: aarch64 cache_info
     Display information about target caches

 -- Command: aarch64 dbginit
     This command enables debugging by clearing the OS Lock and sticky
     power-down and reset indications.  It also establishes the
     expected, basic cross-trigger configuration the aarch64 target code
     relies on.  In a configuration file, the command would typically be
     called from a 'reset-end' or 'reset-deassert-post' handler, to
     re-enable debugging after a system reset.  However, normally it is
     not necessary to use the command at all.

 -- Command: aarch64 disassemble address [count]
     Disassembles COUNT instructions starting at ADDRESS.  If COUNT is
     not specified, a single instruction is disassembled.

 -- Command: aarch64 smp [on|off]
     Display, enable or disable SMP handling mode.  The state of SMP
     handling influences the way targets in an SMP group are handled by
     the run control.  With SMP handling enabled, issuing halt or resume
     to one core will trigger halting or resuming of all cores in the
     group.  The command 'target smp' defines which targets are in the
     SMP group.  With SMP handling disabled, all targets need to be
     treated individually.

 -- Command: aarch64 maskisr ['on'|'off']
     Selects whether interrupts will be processed when single stepping.
     The default configuration is 'on'.

 -- Command: $target_name catch_exc
          ['off'|'sec_el1'|'sec_el3'|'nsec_el1'|'nsec_el2']+
     Cause '$target_name' to halt when an exception is taken.  Any
     combination of Secure (sec) EL1/EL3 or Non-Secure (nsec) EL1/EL2 is
     valid.  The target '$target_name' will halt before taking the
     exception.  In order to resume the target, the exception catch must
     be disabled again with '$target_name catch_exc off'.  Issuing the
     command without options prints the current configuration.

16.7 EnSilica eSi-RISC Architecture
===================================

eSi-RISC is a highly configurable microprocessor architecture for
embedded systems provided by EnSilica.  (See:
<http://www.ensilica.com/risc-ip/>.)

16.7.1 eSi-RISC Configuration
-----------------------------

 -- Command: esirisc cache_arch ('harvard'|'von_neumann')
     Configure the caching architecture.  Targets with the
     'UNIFIED_ADDRESS_SPACE' option disabled employ a Harvard
     architecture.  By default, 'von_neumann' is assumed.

 -- Command: esirisc hwdc ('all'|'none'|mask ...)
     Configure hardware debug control.  The HWDC register controls which
     exceptions return control back to the debugger.  Possible masks are
     'all', 'none', 'reset', 'interrupt', 'syscall', 'error', and
     'debug'.  By default, 'reset', 'error', and 'debug' are enabled.

16.7.2 eSi-RISC Operation
-------------------------

 -- Command: esirisc flush_caches
     Flush instruction and data caches.  This command requires that the
     target is halted when the command is issued and configured with an
     instruction or data cache.

16.7.3 eSi-Trace Configuration
------------------------------

eSi-RISC targets may be configured with support for instruction tracing.
Trace data may be written to an in-memory buffer or FIFO. If a FIFO is
configured, DMA is typically employed to move trace data off-device
using a high-speed peripheral (eg.  SPI). Collected trace data is
encoded in one of three different formats.  At a minimum, 'esirisc trace
buffer' or 'esirisc trace fifo' must be issued along with 'esirisc trace
format' before trace data can be collected.

OpenOCD provides rudimentary analysis of collected trace data.  If more
detail is needed, collected trace data can be dumped to a file and
processed by external tooling.

     Issues: OpenOCD is unable to process trace data sent to a FIFO. A
     potential workaround for this issue is to configure DMA to copy
     trace data to an in-memory buffer, which can then be passed to the
     'esirisc trace analyze' and 'esirisc trace dump' commands.

     It is possible to corrupt trace data when using a FIFO if the
     peripheral responsible for draining data from the FIFO is not fast
     enough.  This can be managed by enabling flow control, however this
     can impact timing-sensitive software operation on the CPU.

 -- Command: esirisc trace buffer address size ['wrap']
     Configure trace buffer using the provided address and size.  If the
     'wrap' option is specified, trace collection will continue once the
     end of the buffer is reached.  By default, wrap is disabled.

 -- Command: esirisc trace fifo address
     Configure trace FIFO using the provided address.

 -- Command: esirisc trace flow_control ('enable'|'disable')
     Enable or disable stalling the CPU to collect trace data.  By
     default, flow control is disabled.

 -- Command: esirisc trace format ('full'|'branch'|'icache') pc_bits
     Configure trace format and number of PC bits to be captured.
     'pc_bits' must be within 1 and 31 as the LSB is not collected.  If
     external tooling is used to analyze collected trace data, these
     values must match.

     Supported trace formats:
        * 'full' capture full trace data, allowing execution history and
          timing to be determined.
        * 'branch' capture taken branch instructions and branch target
          addresses.
        * 'icache' capture instruction cache misses.

 -- Command: esirisc trace trigger start ('condition') [start_data
          start_mask]
     Configure trigger start condition using the provided start data and
     mask.  A brief description of each condition is provided below; for
     more detail on how these values are used, see the eSi-RISC
     Architecture Manual.

     Supported conditions:
        * 'none' manual tracing (see 'esirisc trace start').
        * 'pc' start tracing if the PC matches start data and mask.
        * 'load' start tracing if the effective address of a load
          instruction matches start data and mask.

16.7.4 eSi-Trace Operation
--------------------------

 -- Command: esirisc trace init
     Initialize trace collection.  This command must be called any time
     the configuration changes.  If a trace buffer has been configured,
     the contents will be overwritten when trace collection starts.

 -- Command: esirisc trace info
     Display trace configuration.

 -- Command: esirisc trace status
     Display trace collection status.

     Stop manual trace collection.

 -- Command: esirisc trace analyze [address size]
     Analyze collected trace data.  This command may only be used if a
     trace buffer has been configured.  If a trace FIFO has been
     configured, trace data must be copied to an in-memory buffer
     identified by the 'address' and 'size' options using DMA.

 -- Command: esirisc trace dump [address size] 'filename'
     Dump collected trace data to file.  This command may only be used

16.8 Intel Architecture
=======================

Intel Quark X10xx is the first product in the Quark family of SoCs.  It
is an IA-32 (Pentium x86 ISA) compatible SoC. The core CPU in the X10xx
is codenamed Lakemont.  Lakemont version 1 (LMT1) is used in X10xx.  The
CPU TAP (Lakemont TAP) is used for software debug and the CLTAP is used
for SoC level operations.  Useful docs are here:

     doc num 329866)
   * Intel Quark SoC X1000 Datasheet (web search for doc num 329676)

16.8.1 x86 32-bit specific commands
-----------------------------------

The three main address spaces for x86 are memory, I/O and configuration
space.  These commands allow a user to read and write to the 64Kbyte I/O
address space.

 -- Command: x86_32 idw address
     Display the contents of a 32-bit I/O port from address range 0x0000
     - 0xffff.

 -- Command: x86_32 idh address
     Display the contents of a 16-bit I/O port from address range 0x0000
     - 0xffff.

 -- Command: x86_32 idb address
     Display the contents of a 8-bit I/O port from address range 0x0000
     - 0xffff.

 -- Command: x86_32 iww address
     Write the contents of a 32-bit I/O port to address range 0x0000 -
     0xffff.

 -- Command: x86_32 iwh address
     Write the contents of a 16-bit I/O port to address range 0x0000 -
     0xffff.

 -- Command: x86_32 iwb address
     Write the contents of a 8-bit I/O port to address range 0x0000 -
     0xffff.

16.9 OpenRISC Architecture
==========================

The OpenRISC CPU is a soft core.  It is used in a programmable SoC which
can be configured with any of the TAP / Debug Unit available.

16.9.1 TAP and Debug Unit selection commands
--------------------------------------------

 -- Command: tap_select ('vjtag'|'mohor'|'xilinx_bscan')
     Select between the Altera Virtual JTAG , Xilinx Virtual JTAG and
     Mohor TAP.
 -- Command: du_select ('adv'|'mohor') [option]
     Select between the Advanced Debug Interface and the classic one.

     An option can be passed as a second argument to the debug unit.

     When using the Advanced Debug Interface, option = 1 means the RTL
     core is configured with ADBG_USE_HISPEED = 1.  This configuration
     skips status checking between bytes while doing read or write
     bursts.

16.9.2 Registers commands
-------------------------

 -- Command: addreg [name] [address] [feature] [reg_group]
     Add a new register in the cpu register list.  This register will be
     included in the generated target descriptor file.

     *[feature]* must be "org.gnu.gdb.or1k.group[0..10]".

     *[reg_group]* can be anything.  The default register list defines
     "system", "dmmu", "immu", "dcache", "icache", "mac", "debug",
     "perf", "power", "pic" and "timer" groups.

     _example:_
          addreg rtest 0x1234 org.gnu.gdb.or1k.group0 system

16.10 RISC-V Architecture
=========================

RISC-V (http://riscv.org/) is a free and open ISA. OpenOCD supports JTAG
debug of RV32 and RV64 cores in heterogeneous multicore systems of up to
32 harts.  (It's possible to increase this limit to 1024 by changing
RISCV_MAX_HARTS in riscv.h.)  OpenOCD primarily supports 0.13 of the
RISC-V Debug Specification, but there is also support for legacy targets
that implement version 0.11.

16.10.1 RISC-V Terminology
--------------------------

A _hart_ is a hardware thread.  A hart may share resources (eg.  FPU)
with another hart, or may be a separate core.  RISC-V treats those the
same, and OpenOCD exposes each hart as a separate core.

16.10.2 Vector Registers
------------------------

For harts that implement the vector extension, OpenOCD provides access
to the relevant CSRs, as well as the vector registers (v0-v31).  The
size of each vector register is dependent on the value of vlenb.  RISC-V
allows each vector register to be divided into selected-width elements,
and this division can be changed at run-time.  Because OpenOCD cannot
update register definitions at run-time, it exposes each vector register
to gdb as a union of fields of vectors so that users can easily access
individual bytes, shorts, words, longs, and quads inside each vector
register.  It is left to gdb or higher-level debuggers to present this
data in a more intuitive format.

In the XML register description, the vector registers (when vlenb=16)
look as follows:

     <feature name="org.gnu.gdb.riscv.vector">
     <vector id="bytes" type="uint8" count="16"/>
     <vector id="shorts" type="uint16" count="8"/>
     <vector id="words" type="uint32" count="4"/>
     <vector id="longs" type="uint64" count="2"/>
     <vector id="quads" type="uint128" count="1"/>
     <union id="riscv_vector">
     <field name="b" type="bytes"/>
     <field name="s" type="shorts"/>
     <field name="w" type="words"/>
     <field name="l" type="longs"/>
     <field name="q" type="quads"/>
     </union>
     <reg name="v0" bitsize="128" regnum="4162" save-restore="no"
             type="riscv_vector" group="vector"/>
     ...
     <reg name="v31" bitsize="128" regnum="4193" save-restore="no"
             type="riscv_vector" group="vector"/>
     </feature>

16.10.3 RISC-V Debug Configuration Commands
-------------------------------------------

 -- Config Command: riscv expose_csrs n[-m|=name] [...]
     Configure which CSRs to expose in addition to the standard ones.
     The CSRs to expose can be specified as individual register numbers
     or register ranges (inclusive).  For the individually listed CSRs,
     a human-readable name can optionally be set using the 'n=name'
     syntax, which will get 'csr_' prepended to it.  If no name is
     provided, the register will be named 'csr<n>'.

     By default OpenOCD attempts to expose only CSRs that are mentioned
     in a spec, and then only if the corresponding extension appears to
     be implemented.  This command can be used if OpenOCD gets this
     wrong, or if the target implements custom CSRs.

          # Expose a single RISC-V CSR number 128 under the name "csr128":
          $_TARGETNAME expose_csrs 128

          # Expose multiple RISC-V CSRs 128..132 under names "csr128" through "csr132":
          $_TARGETNAME expose_csrs 128-132

          # Expose a single RISC-V CSR number 1996 under custom name "csr_myregister":
          $_TARGETNAME expose_csrs 1996=myregister

 -- Config Command: riscv expose_custom n[-m|=name] [...]
     The RISC-V Debug Specification allows targets to expose custom
     registers through abstract commands.  (See Section 3.5.1.1 in that
     document.)  This command configures individual registers or
     register ranges (inclusive) that shall be exposed.  Number 0
     indicates the first custom register, whose abstract command number
     is 0xc000.  For individually listed registers, a human-readable
     name can be optionally provided using the 'n=name' syntax, which
     will get 'custom_' prepended to it.  If no name is provided, the
     register will be named 'custom<n>'.

          # Expose one RISC-V custom register with number 0xc010 (0xc000 + 16)
          # under the name "custom16":
          $_TARGETNAME expose_custom 16

          # Expose a range of RISC-V custom registers with numbers 0xc010 .. 0xc018
          # (0xc000+16 .. 0xc000+24) under the names "custom16" through "custom24":
          $_TARGETNAME expose_custom 16-24

          # Expose one RISC-V custom register with number 0xc020 (0xc000 + 32) under
          # user-defined name "custom_myregister":
          $_TARGETNAME expose_custom 32=myregister

 -- Command: riscv set_command_timeout_sec [seconds]
     Set the wall-clock timeout (in seconds) for individual commands.
     The default should work fine for all but the slowest targets (eg.
     simulators).

 -- Command: riscv set_reset_timeout_sec [seconds]
     Set the maximum time to wait for a hart to come out of reset after
     reset is deasserted.

 -- Command: riscv set_scratch_ram none|[address]
     Set the address of 16 bytes of scratch RAM the debugger can use, or
     'none'.  This is used to access 64-bit floating point registers on
     32-bit targets.

 -- Command: riscv set_mem_access method1 [method2] [method3]
     Specify which RISC-V memory access method(s) shall be used, and in
     which order of priority.  At least one method must be specified.

     Available methods are:
        * 'progbuf' - Use RISC-V Debug Program Buffer to access memory.
        * 'sysbus' - Access memory via RISC-V Debug System Bus
          interface.
        * 'abstract' - Access memory via RISC-V Debug abstract commands.

     By default, all memory access methods are enabled in the following
     order: 'progbuf sysbus abstract'.

     This command can be used to change the memory access methods if the
     default behavior is not suitable for a particular target.

 -- Command: riscv set_enable_virtual on|off
     When on, memory accesses are performed on physical or virtual
     memory depending on the current system configuration.  When off
     (default), all memory accessses are performed on physical memory.

 -- Command: riscv set_enable_virt2phys on|off
     When on (default), memory accesses are performed on physical or
     virtual memory depending on the current satp configuration.  When
     off, all memory accessses are performed on physical memory.

 -- Command: riscv resume_order normal|reversed
     Some software assumes all harts are executing nearly continuously.
     Such software may be sensitive to the order that harts are resumed
     in.  On harts that don't support hasel, this option allows the user
     to choose the order the harts are resumed in.  If you are using
     this option, it's probably masking a race condition problem in your
     code.

     Normal order is from lowest hart index to highest.  This is the
     default behavior.  Reversed order is from highest hart index to
     lowest.

 -- Command: riscv set_ir ('idcode'|'dtmcs'|'dmi') [value]
     Set the IR value for the specified JTAG register.  This is useful,
     for example, when using the existing JTAG interface on a Xilinx
     FPGA by way of BSCANE2 primitives that only permit a limited
     selection of IR values.

     When utilizing version 0.11 of the RISC-V Debug Specification,
     'dtmcs' and 'dmi' set the IR values for the DTMCONTROL and DBUS
     registers, respectively.

 -- Command: riscv use_bscan_tunnel value
     Enable or disable use of a BSCAN tunnel to reach DM. Supply the
     width of the DM transport TAP's instruction register to enable.
     Supply a value of 0 to disable.

 -- Command: riscv set_maskisr ['off'|'steponly']
     Selects whether interrupts will be disabled when single stepping.
     The default configuration is 'off'.  This feature is only useful on
     hardware that always steps into interrupts and doesn't support
     dcsr.stepie=0.  Keep in mind, disabling the option does not
     guarantee that single stepping will go into interrupt handlers.  To
     make that happen, dcsr.stepie would have to be written to 1 as
     well.

 -- Command: riscv set_ebreakm on|off
     Control dcsr.ebreakm.  When on (default), M-mode ebreak
     instructions trap to OpenOCD. When off, they generate a breakpoint
     exception handled internally.

 -- Command: riscv set_ebreaks on|off
     Control dcsr.ebreaks.  When on (default), S-mode ebreak
     instructions trap to OpenOCD. When off, they generate a breakpoint
     exception handled internally.

 -- Command: riscv set_ebreaku on|off
     Control dcsr.ebreaku.  When on (default), U-mode ebreak
     instructions trap to OpenOCD. When off, they generate a breakpoint
     exception handled internally.

16.10.4 RISC-V Authentication Commands
--------------------------------------

The following commands can be used to authenticate to a RISC-V system.
Eg.  a trivial challenge-response protocol could be implemented as
follows in a configuration file, immediately following 'init':
     set challenge [riscv authdata_read]
     riscv authdata_write [expr {$challenge + 1}]

 -- Command: riscv authdata_read
     Return the 32-bit value read from authdata.

 -- Command: riscv authdata_write value
     Write the 32-bit value to authdata.

16.10.5 RISC-V DMI Commands
---------------------------

The following commands allow direct access to the Debug Module
Interface, which can be used to interact with custom debug features.

 -- Command: riscv dmi_read address
     Perform a 32-bit DMI read at address, returning the value.

 -- Command: riscv dmi_write address value
     Perform a 32-bit DMI write of value at address.

16.11 ARC Architecture
======================

Synopsys DesignWare ARC Processors are a family of 32-bit CPUs that SoC
designers can optimize for a wide range of uses, from deeply embedded to
high-performance host applications in a variety of market segments.  See
more at:
<http://www.synopsys.com/IP/ProcessorIP/ARCProcessors/Pages/default.aspx>.
OpenOCD currently supports ARC EM processors.  There is a set
ARC-specific OpenOCD commands that allow low-level access to the core
and provide necessary support for ARC extensibility and configurability
capabilities.  ARC processors has much more configuration capabilities
than most of the other processors and in addition there is an extension
interface that allows SoC designers to add custom registers and
instructions.  For the OpenOCD that mostly means that set of core and
AUX registers in target will vary and is not fixed for a particular
processor model.  To enable extensibility several TCL commands are
provided that allow to describe those optional registers in OpenOCD
configuration files.  Moreover those commands allow for a dynamic target
features discovery.

16.11.1 General ARC commands
----------------------------

 -- Config Command: arc add-reg configparams

     Add a new register to processor target.  By default newly created
     register is marked as not existing.  CONFIGPARAMS must have
     following required arguments:

        * '-name' name
          Name of a register.

        * '-num' number
          Architectural register number: core register number or AUX
          register number.

        * '-feature' XML_feature
          Name of GDB XML target description feature.

     CONFIGPARAMS may have following optional arguments:

        * '-gdbnum' number
          GDB register number.  It is recommended to not assign GDB
          register number manually, because there would be a risk that
          two register will have same number.  When register GDB number
          is not set with this option, then register will get a previous
          register number + 1.  This option is required only for those
          registers that must be at particular address expected by GDB.

        * '-core'
          This option specifies that register is a core registers.  If
          not - this is an AUX register.  AUX registers and core
          registers reside in different address spaces.

        * '-bcr'
          This options specifies that register is a BCR register.  BCR
          means Build Configuration Registers - this is a special type
          of AUX registers that are read only and non-volatile, that is
          - they never change their value.  Therefore OpenOCD never
          invalidates values of those registers in internal caches.
          Because BCR is a type of AUX registers, this option cannot be
          used with '-core'.

        * '-type' type_name
          Name of type of this register.  This can be either one of the
          basic GDB types, or a custom types described with 'arc
          add-reg-type-[flags|struct]'.

        * '-g'
          If specified then this is a "general" register.  General
          registers are always read by OpenOCD on context save (when
          core has just been halted) and is always transferred to GDB
          client in a response to g-packet.  Contrary to this,
          non-general registers are read and sent to GDB client
          on-demand.  In general it is not recommended to apply this
          option to custom registers.

 -- Config Command: arc add-reg-type-flags -name name flags...
     Adds new register type of "flags" class.  "Flags" types can contain
     only one-bit fields.  Each flag definition looks like '-flag name
     bit-position'.

 -- Config Command: arc add-reg-type-struct -name name structs...
     Adds new register type of "struct" class.  "Struct" types can
     contain either bit-fields or fields of other types, however at the
     moment only bit fields are supported.  Structure bit field
     definition looks like '-bitfield name startbit endbit'.

 -- Command: arc get-reg-field reg-name field-name
     Returns value of bit-field in a register.  Register must be
     "struct" register type, *Note add-reg-type-struct::.  command
     definition.

 -- Command: arc set-reg-exists reg-names...
     Specify that some register exists.  Any amount of names can be
     passed as an argument for a single command invocation.

16.11.2 ARC JTAG commands
-------------------------

 -- Command: arc jtag set-aux-reg regnum value
     This command writes value to AUX register via its number.  This
     command access register in target directly via JTAG, bypassing any
     OpenOCD internal caches, therefore it is unsafe to use if that
     register can be operated by other means.

 -- Command: arc jtag set-core-reg regnum value
     This command is similar to 'arc jtag set-aux-reg' but is for core
     registers.

 -- Command: arc jtag get-aux-reg regnum
     This command returns the value storded in AUX register via its
     number.  This commands access register in target directly via JTAG,
     bypassing any OpenOCD internal caches, therefore it is unsafe to
     use if that register can be operated by other means.

 -- Command: arc jtag get-core-reg regnum
     This command is similar to 'arc jtag get-aux-reg' but is for core
     registers.

16.12 STM8 Architecture
=======================

STM8 (http://st.com/stm8/) is a 8-bit microcontroller platform from
STMicroelectronics, based on a proprietary 8-bit core architecture.

OpenOCD supports debugging STM8 through the STMicroelectronics debug
protocol SWIM, *note SWIM: swimtransport.

16.13 Xtensa Architecture
=========================

Xtensa processors are based on a modular, highly flexible 32-bit RISC
architecture that can easily scale from a tiny, cache-less controller or
task engine to a high-performance SIMD/VLIW DSP provided by Cadence.
<https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/ip/tensilica-ip/tensilica-xtensa-controllers-and-extensible-processors.html>.

OpenOCD supports generic Xtensa processors implementation which can be
customized by simply providing vendor-specific core configuration which
controls every configurable Xtensa architecture option, e.g.  number of
address registers, exceptions, reduced size instructions support, memory
banks configuration etc.  Also OpenOCD supports SMP configurations for
Xtensa processors with any number of cores and allows to configure their
debug signals interconnection (so-called "break/stall networks") which
control how debug signals are distributed among cores.  Xtensa "break
networks" are compatible with ARM's Cross Trigger Interface (CTI). For
debugging code on Xtensa chips OpenOCD uses JTAG protocol.  Currently
OpenOCD implements several Epsressif Xtensa-based chips of ESP32 family
(https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs).

16.13.1 General Xtensa Commands
-------------------------------

 -- Command: xtensa set_permissive (0|1)
     By default accessing memory beyond defined regions is forbidden.
     This commnd controls memory access address check.  When set to (1),
     skips access controls and address range check before read/write
     memory.

 -- Command: xtensa maskisr (on|off)
     Selects whether interrupts will be disabled during stepping over
     single instruction.  The default configuration is (off).

 -- Command: xtensa smpbreak [none|breakinout|runstall] | [BreakIn]
          [BreakOut] [RunStallIn] [DebugModeOut]
     Configures debug signals connection ("break network") for currently
     selected core.
        * 'none' - Core's "break/stall network" is disconnected.  Core
          is not affected by any debug signal from other cores.
        * 'breakinout' - Core's "break network" is fully connected
          (break inputs and outputs are enabled).  Core will receive
          debug break signals from other cores and send such signals to
          them.  For example when another core is stopped due to
          breakpoint hit this core will be stopped too and vice versa.
        * 'runstall' - Core's "stall network" is fully connected (stall
          inputs and outputs are enabled).  This feature is not well
          implemented and tested yet.
        * 'BreakIn' - Core's "break-in" signal is enabled.  Core will
          receive debug break signals from other cores.  For example
          when another core is stopped due to breakpoint hit this core
          will be stopped too.
        * 'BreakOut' - Core's "break-out" signal is enabled.  Core will
          send debug break signal to other cores.  For example when this

        * 'mask' - Selects input subsets to be counted (counter will
          increment only once even if more than one condition
          corresponding to a mask bit occurs).
        * 'kernelcnt' - 0 - count events with "CINTLEVEL <= tracelevel",
          1 - count events with "CINTLEVEL > tracelevel".

16.15 Software Debug Messages and Tracing
=========================================

OpenOCD can process certain requests from target software, when the
target uses appropriate libraries.  The most powerful mechanism is
semihosting, but there is also a lighter weight mechanism using only the
DCC channel.

Currently 'target_request debugmsgs' is supported only for 'arm7_9' and
'cortex_m' cores.  These messages are received as part of target
polling, so you need to have 'poll on' active to receive them.  They are
intrusive in that they will affect program execution times.  If that is
a problem, *note ARM Hardware Tracing: armhardwaretracing.

See 'libdcc' in the contrib dir for more details.  In addition to
sending strings, characters, and arrays of various size integers from
the target, 'libdcc' also exports a software trace point mechanism.  The
target being debugged may issue trace messages which include a 24-bit
"trace point" number.  Trace point support includes two distinct
mechanisms, each supported by a command:

   * _History_ ...  A circular buffer of trace points can be set up, and
     then displayed at any time.  This tracks where code has been, which
     can be invaluable in finding out how some fault was triggered.

     The buffer may overflow, since it collects records continuously.
     It may be useful to use some of the 24 bits to represent a
     particular event, and other bits to hold data.

   * _Counting_ ...  An array of counters can be set up, and then
     displayed at any time.  This can help establish code coverage and
     identify hot spots.

     The array of counters is directly indexed by the trace point
     number, so trace points with higher numbers are not counted.

Linux-ARM kernels have a "Kernel low-level debugging via EmbeddedICE DCC
channel" option (CONFIG_DEBUG_ICEDCC, depends on CONFIG_DEBUG_LL) which
uses this mechanism to deliver messages before a serial console can be
activated.  This is not the same format used by 'libdcc'.  Other
software, such as the U-Boot boot loader, sometimes does the same thing.

 -- Command: target_request debugmsgs ['enable'|'disable'|'charmsg']
     Displays current handling of target DCC message requests.  These
     messages may be sent to the debugger while the target is running.
     The optional 'enable' and 'charmsg' parameters both enable the
     messages, while 'disable' disables them.

     With 'charmsg' the DCC words each contain one character, as used by
     Linux with CONFIG_DEBUG_ICEDCC; otherwise the libdcc format is
     used.

 -- Command: trace history ['clear'|count]
     With no parameter, displays all the trace points that have
     triggered in the order they triggered.  With the parameter 'clear',
     erases all current trace history records.  With a COUNT parameter,
     allocates space for that many history records.

 -- Command: trace point ['clear'|identifier]
     With no parameter, displays all trace point identifiers and how
     many times they have been triggered.  With the parameter 'clear',
     erases all current trace point counters.  With a numeric IDENTIFIER
     parameter, creates a new a trace point counter and associates it
     with that identifier.

     _Important:_ The identifier and the trace point number are not
     related except by this command.  These trace point numbers always
     start at zero (from server startup, or after 'trace point clear')
     and count up from there.


File: openocd.info,  Node: JTAG Commands,  Next: Boundary Scan Commands,  Prev: Architecture and Core Commands,  Up: Top

17 JTAG Commands
****************

Most general purpose JTAG commands have been presented earlier.  (*Note
JTAG Speed: jtagspeed, *note Reset Configuration::, and *note TAP
Declaration::.)  Lower level JTAG commands, as presented here, may be
needed to work with targets which require special attention during
operations such as reset or initialization.

To use these commands you will need to understand some of the basics of
JTAG, including:

   * A JTAG scan chain consists of a sequence of individual TAP devices
     such as a CPUs.
   * Control operations involve moving each TAP through the same
     standard state machine (in parallel) using their shared TMS and
     clock signals.
   * Data transfer involves shifting data through the chain of
     instruction or data registers of each TAP, writing new register
     values while the reading previous ones.
   * Data register sizes are a function of the instruction active in a
     given TAP, while instruction register sizes are fixed for each TAP.
     All TAPs support a BYPASS instruction with a single bit data
     register.
   * The way OpenOCD differentiates between TAP devices is by shifting
     different instructions into (and out of) their instruction
     registers.

17.1 Low Level JTAG Commands
============================

These commands are used by developers who need to access JTAG
instruction or data registers, possibly controlling the order of TAP
state transitions.  If you're not debugging OpenOCD internals, or
bringing up a new JTAG adapter or a new type of TAP device (like a CPU
or JTAG router), you probably won't need to use these commands.  In a
debug session that doesn't use JTAG for its transport protocol, these
commands are not available.

 -- Command: drscan tap [numbits value]+ ['-endstate' tap_state]
     Loads the data register of TAP with a series of bit fields that
     specify the entire register.  Each field is NUMBITS bits long with
     a numeric VALUE (hexadecimal encouraged).  The return value holds
     the original value of each of those fields.

     For example, a 38 bit number might be specified as one field of 32
     bits then one of 6 bits.  _For portability, never pass fields which
     are more than 32 bits long.  Many OpenOCD implementations do not
     support 64-bit (or larger) integer values._

     All TAPs other than TAP must be in BYPASS mode.  The single bit in
     their data registers does not matter.

     When TAP_STATE is specified, the JTAG state machine is left in that
     state.  For example DRPAUSE might be specified, so that more
     instructions can be issued before re-entering the RUN/IDLE state.
     If the end state is not specified, the RUN/IDLE state is entered.

          Warning: OpenOCD does not record information about data
          register lengths, so _it is important that you get the bit
          field lengths right_.  Remember that different JTAG
          instructions refer to different data registers, which may have
          different lengths.  Moreover, those lengths may not be fixed;
          the SCAN_N instruction can change the length of the register
          accessed by the INTEST instruction (by connecting a different
          scan chain).

 -- Command: flush_count
     Returns the number of times the JTAG queue has been flushed.  This
     may be used for performance tuning.

     For example, flushing a queue over USB involves a minimum latency,
     often several milliseconds, which does not change with the amount
     of data which is written.  You may be able to identify performance
     problems by finding tasks which waste bandwidth by flushing small
     transfers too often, instead of batching them into larger
     operations.

 -- Command: irscan [tap instruction]+ ['-endstate' tap_state]
     For each TAP listed, loads the instruction register with its
     associated numeric INSTRUCTION.  (The number of bits in that
     instruction may be displayed using the 'scan_chain' command.)  For
     other TAPs, a BYPASS instruction is loaded.

     When TAP_STATE is specified, the JTAG state machine is left in that
     state.  For example IRPAUSE might be specified, so the data
     register can be loaded before re-entering the RUN/IDLE state.  If
     the end state is not specified, the RUN/IDLE state is entered.

          Note: OpenOCD currently supports only a single field for
          instruction register values, unlike data register values.  For
          TAPs where the instruction register length is more than 32
          bits, portable scripts currently must issue only BYPASS
          instructions.

 -- Command: pathmove start_state [next_state ...]
     Start by moving to START_STATE, which must be one of the _stable_
     states.  Unless it is the only state given, this will often be the
     current state, so that no TCK transitions are needed.  Then, in a
     series of single state transitions (conforming to the JTAG state
     machine) shift to each NEXT_STATE in sequence, one per TCK cycle.
     The final state must also be stable.

 -- Command: runtest NUM_CYCLES
     Move to the RUN/IDLE state, and execute at least NUM_CYCLES of the
     JTAG clock (TCK). Instructions often need some time to execute
     before they take effect.

 -- Command: verify_ircapture ('enable'|'disable')
     Verify values captured during IRCAPTURE and returned during IR
     scans.  Default is enabled, but this can be overridden by
     'verify_jtag'.  This flag is ignored when validating JTAG chain
     configuration.

 -- Command: verify_jtag ('enable'|'disable')
     Enables verification of DR and IR scans, to help detect programming
     errors.  For IR scans, 'verify_ircapture' must also be enabled.
     Default is enabled.

17.2 TAP state names
====================

The TAP_STATE names used by OpenOCD in the 'drscan', 'irscan', and
'pathmove' commands are the same as those used in SVF boundary scan
documents, except that SVF uses IDLE instead of RUN/IDLE.

   * RESET ...  _stable_ (with TMS high); acts as if TRST were pulsed
   * RUN/IDLE ...  _stable_; don't assume this always means IDLE
   * DRSELECT
   * DRCAPTURE
   * DRSHIFT ...  _stable_; TDI/TDO shifting through the data register
   * DREXIT1
   * DRPAUSE ...  _stable_; data register ready for update or more
     shifting
   * DREXIT2
   * DRUPDATE
   * IRSELECT
   * IRCAPTURE
   * IRSHIFT ...  _stable_; TDI/TDO shifting through the instruction
     register
   * IREXIT1
   * IRPAUSE ...  _stable_; instruction register ready for update or
     more shifting
   * IREXIT2
   * IRUPDATE

Note that only six of those states are fully "stable" in the face of TMS
fixed (low except for RESET) and a free-running JTAG clock.  For all the
others, the next TCK transition changes to a new state.

   * From DRSHIFT and IRSHIFT, clock transitions will produce side
     effects by changing register contents.  The values to be latched in
     upcoming DRUPDATE or IRUPDATE states may not be as expected.
   * RUN/IDLE, DRPAUSE, and IRPAUSE are reasonable choices after
     'drscan' or 'irscan' commands, since they are free of JTAG side
     effects.
   * RUN/IDLE may have side effects that appear at non-JTAG levels, such
     as advancing the ARM9E-S instruction pipeline.  Consult the
     documentation for the TAP(s) you are working with.

18 Boundary Scan Commands
*************************

One of the original purposes of JTAG was to support boundary scan based
hardware testing.  Although its primary focus is to support On-Chip
Debugging, OpenOCD also includes some boundary scan commands.

18.1 SVF: Serial Vector Format
==============================

The Serial Vector Format, better known as "SVF", is a way to represent
JTAG test patterns in text files.  In a debug session using JTAG for its
transport protocol, OpenOCD supports running such test files.

 -- Command: svf 'filename' ['-tap TAPNAME'] ['[-]quiet'] ['[-]nil']
          ['[-]progress'] ['[-]ignore_error']
     This issues a JTAG reset (Test-Logic-Reset) and then runs the SVF
     script from 'filename'.

     Arguments can be specified in any order; the optional dash doesn't
     affect their semantics.

     Command options:
        - '-tap TAPNAME' ignore IR and DR headers and footers specified
          by the SVF file with HIR, TIR, HDR and TDR commands; instead,
          calculate them automatically according to the current JTAG
          chain configuration, targeting TAPNAME;
        - '[-]quiet' do not log every command before execution;
        - '[-]nil' "dry run", i.e., do not perform any operations on the
          real interface;
        - '[-]progress' enable progress indication;
        - '[-]ignore_error' continue execution despite TDO check errors.

18.2 XSVF: Xilinx Serial Vector Format
======================================

The Xilinx Serial Vector Format, better known as "XSVF", is a binary
representation of SVF which is optimized for use with Xilinx devices.
In a debug session using JTAG for its transport protocol, OpenOCD
supports running such test files.

     Important: Not all XSVF commands are supported.

 -- Command: xsvf (tapname|'plain') filename ['virt2'] ['quiet']
     This issues a JTAG reset (Test-Logic-Reset) and then runs the XSVF
     script from 'filename'.  When a TAPNAME is specified, the commands
     are directed at that TAP. When 'virt2' is specified, the XRUNTEST
     command counts are interpreted as TCK cycles instead of
     microseconds.  Unless the 'quiet' option is specified, messages are
     logged for comments and some retries.

The OpenOCD sources also include two utility scripts for working with
XSVF; they are not currently installed after building the software.  You
may find them useful:

   * _svf2xsvf_ ...  converts SVF files into the extended XSVF syntax
     understood by the 'xsvf' command; see notes below.
   * _xsvfdump_ ...  converts XSVF files into a text output format;
     understands the OpenOCD extensions.

The input format accepts a handful of non-standard extensions.  These
include three opcodes corresponding to SVF extensions from Lattice
Semiconductor (LCOUNT, LDELAY, LDSR), and two opcodes supporting a more
accurate translation of SVF (XTRST, XWAITSTATE). If _xsvfdump_ shows a
file is using those opcodes, it probably will not be usable with other
XSVF tools.

18.3 IPDBG: JTAG-Host server
============================

IPDBG is a set of tools to debug IP-Cores.  It comprises, among others,
a logic analyzer and an arbitrary waveform generator.  These are
synthesize-able hardware descriptions of logic circuits in addition to
software for control, visualization and further analysis.  In a session
using JTAG for its transport protocol, OpenOCD supports the function of
a JTAG-Host.  The JTAG-Host is needed to connect the circuit over JTAG
to the control-software.  For more details see <http://ipdbg.org>.

 -- Command: ipdbg ['-start|-stop'] '-tap TAPNAME' '-hub IR_VALUE
          [DR_LENGTH]' ['-port NUMBER'] ['-tool NUMBER'] ['-vir
          [VIR_VALUE [LENGTH [INSTR_CODE]]]']
     Starts or stops a IPDBG JTAG-Host server.  Arguments can be
     specified in any order.

     Command options:
        * '-start|-stop' starts or stops a IPDBG JTAG-Host server
          (default: start).
        * '-tap TAPNAME' targeting the TAP TAPNAME.
        * '-hub IR_VALUE' states that the JTAG hub is reachable with
          dr-scans while the JTAG instruction register has the value
          IR_VALUE.
        * '-port NUMBER' tcp port number where the JTAG-Host is
          listening.
        * '-tool NUMBER' number of the tool/feature.  These corresponds
          to the ports "data_(up/down)_(0..6)" at the JtagHub.
        * '-vir [VIR_VALUE [LENGTH [INSTR_CODE]]]' On some devices, the
          user data-register is only reachable if there is a specific
          value in a second dr.  This second dr is called vir (virtual
          ir).  With this parameter given, the IPDBG satisfies this
          condition prior an access to the IPDBG-Hub.  The value shifted
          into the vir is given by the first parameter VIR_VALUE
          (default: 0x11).  The second parameter LENGTH is the length of
          the vir data register (default: 5).  With the INSTR_CODE
          (default: 0x00e) parameter the ir value to shift data through
          vir can be configured.

Examples:
     ipdbg -start -tap xc6s.tap -hub 0x02 -port 4242 -tool 4
Starts a server listening on tcp-port 4242 which connects to tool 4.
The connection is through the TAP of a Xilinx Spartan 6 on USER1
instruction (tested with a papillion pro board).

     ipdbg -start -tap 10m50.tap -hub 0x00C -vir -port 60000 -tool 1
Starts a server listening on tcp-port 60000 which connects to tool 1
(data_up_1/data_down_1).  The connection is through the TAP of a Intel
MAX10 virtual jtag component (sld_instance_index is 0; sld_ir_width is
smaller than 5).

19 Utility Commands
*******************

19.1 RAM testing
================

There is often a need to stress-test random access memory (RAM) for
errors.  OpenOCD comes with a Tcl implementation of well-known memory
testing procedures allowing the detection of all sorts of issues with
electrical wiring, defective chips, PCB layout and other common hardware
problems.

To use them, you usually need to initialise your RAM controller first;
consult your SoC's documentation to get the recommended list of register
operations and translate them to the corresponding 'mww'/'mwb' commands.

Load the memory testing functions with

     source [find tools/memtest.tcl]

to get access to the following facilities:

 -- Command: memTestDataBus address
     Test the data bus wiring in a memory region by performing a walking
     1's test at a fixed address within that region.

 -- Command: memTestAddressBus baseaddress size
     Perform a walking 1's test on the relevant bits of the address and
     check for aliasing.  This test will find single-bit address
     failures such as stuck-high, stuck-low, and shorted pins.

 -- Command: memTestDevice baseaddress size
     Test the integrity of a physical memory device by performing an
     increment/decrement test over the entire region.  In the process
     every storage bit in the device is tested as zero and as one.

 -- Command: runAllMemTests baseaddress size
     Run all of the above tests over a specified memory region.

19.2 Firmware recovery helpers
==============================

OpenOCD includes an easy-to-use script to facilitate mass-market devices
recovery with JTAG.

20 GDB and OpenOCD
******************

OpenOCD complies with the remote gdbserver protocol and, as such, can be
used to debug remote targets.  Setting up GDB to work with OpenOCD can
involve several components:

   * The OpenOCD server support for GDB may need to be configured.
     *Note GDB Configuration: gdbconfiguration.
   * GDB's support for OpenOCD may need configuration, as shown in this
     chapter.
   * If you have a GUI environment like Eclipse, that also will probably
     need to be configured.

Of course, the version of GDB you use will need to be one which has been
built to know about the target CPU you're using.  It's probably part of
the tool chain you're using.  For example, if you are doing
cross-development for ARM on an x86 PC, instead of using the native x86
'gdb' command you might use 'arm-none-eabi-gdb' if that's the tool chain
used to compile your code.

20.1 Connecting to GDB
======================

Use GDB 6.7 or newer with OpenOCD if you run into trouble.  For instance
GDB 6.3 has a known bug that produces bogus memory access errors, which
has since been fixed; see
<http://osdir.com/ml/gdb.bugs.discuss/2004-12/msg00018.html>

OpenOCD can communicate with GDB in two ways:

  1. A socket (TCP/IP) connection is typically started as follows:
          target extended-remote localhost:3333
     This would cause GDB to connect to the gdbserver on the local pc
     using port 3333.

     The extended remote protocol is a super-set of the remote protocol
     and should be the preferred choice.  More details are available in
     GDB documentation
     <https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Connecting.html>

     To speed-up typing, any GDB command can be abbreviated, including
     the extended remote command above that becomes:
          tar ext :3333

     Note: If any backward compatibility issue requires using the old
     remote protocol in place of the extended remote one, the former
     protocol is still available through the command:
          target remote localhost:3333

  2. A pipe connection is typically started as follows:
          target extended-remote | \
                 openocd -c "gdb_port pipe; log_output openocd.log"
     This would cause GDB to run OpenOCD and communicate using pipes
     (stdin/stdout).  Using this method has the advantage of GDB
     starting/stopping OpenOCD for the debug session.  log_output sends
     the log output to a file to ensure that the pipe is not saturated
     when using higher debug level outputs.

To list the available OpenOCD commands type 'monitor help' on the GDB
command line.

20.2 Sample GDB session startup
===============================

With the remote protocol, GDB sessions start a little differently than
they do when you're debugging locally.  Here's an example showing how to
start a debug session with a small ARM program.  In this case the
program was linked to be loaded into SRAM on a Cortex-M3.  Most programs
would be written into flash (address 0) and run from there.

     $ arm-none-eabi-gdb example.elf
     (gdb) target extended-remote localhost:3333
     Remote debugging using localhost:3333
     ...
     (gdb) monitor reset halt
     ...
     (gdb) load
     Loading section .vectors, size 0x100 lma 0x20000000
     Loading section .text, size 0x5a0 lma 0x20000100
     Loading section .data, size 0x18 lma 0x200006a0
     Start address 0x2000061c, load size 1720
     Transfer rate: 22 KB/sec, 573 bytes/write.
     (gdb) continue
     Continuing.
     ...

You could then interrupt the GDB session to make the program break, type
'where' to show the stack, 'list' to show the code around the program
counter, 'step' through code, set breakpoints or watchpoints, and so on.

20.3 Configuring GDB for OpenOCD
================================

OpenOCD supports the gdb 'qSupported' packet, this enables information
to be sent by the GDB remote server (i.e.  OpenOCD) to GDB. Typical
information includes packet size and the device's memory map.  You do
not need to configure the packet size by hand, and the relevant parts of
the memory map should be automatically set up when you declare (NOR)
flash banks.

However, there are other things which GDB can't currently query.  You
may need to set those up by hand.  As OpenOCD starts up, you will often
see a line reporting something like:

     Info : lm3s.cpu: hardware has 6 breakpoints, 4 watchpoints

You can pass that information to GDB with these commands:

     set remote hardware-breakpoint-limit 6
     set remote hardware-watchpoint-limit 4

With that particular hardware (Cortex-M3) the hardware breakpoints only
work for code running from flash memory.  Most other ARM systems do not
have such restrictions.

Rather than typing such commands interactively, you may prefer to save
them in a file and have GDB execute them as it starts, perhaps using a
'.gdbinit' in your project directory or starting GDB using 'gdb -x
filename'.

20.4 Programming using GDB
==========================

By default the target memory map is sent to GDB. This can be disabled by
the following OpenOCD configuration option:
     gdb_memory_map disable
For this to function correctly a valid flash configuration must also be
set in OpenOCD. For faster performance you should also configure a valid
working area.

Informing GDB of the memory map of the target will enable GDB to protect
any flash areas of the target and use hardware breakpoints by default.
This means that the OpenOCD option 'gdb_breakpoint_override' is not
required when using a memory map.  *Note gdb_breakpoint_override:
gdbbreakpointoverride.

To view the configured memory map in GDB, use the GDB command 'info
mem'.  All other unassigned addresses within GDB are treated as RAM.

GDB 6.8 and higher set any memory area not in the memory map as
inaccessible.  This can be changed to the old behaviour by using the
following GDB command
     set mem inaccessible-by-default off

If 'gdb_flash_program enable' is also used, GDB will be able to program
any flash memory using the vFlash interface.

GDB will look at the target memory map when a load command is given, if
any areas to be programmed lie within the target flash area the vFlash
packets will be used.

If the target needs configuring before GDB programming, set target event
gdb-flash-erase-start:
     $_TARGETNAME configure -event gdb-flash-erase-start BODY
*Note Target Events: targetevents, for other GDB programming related
events.

To verify any flash programming the GDB command 'compare-sections' can
be used.

20.5 Using GDB as a non-intrusive memory inspector
==================================================

If your project controls more than a blinking LED, let's say a heavy
industrial robot or an experimental nuclear reactor, stopping the
controlling process just because you want to attach GDB is not a good
option.

OpenOCD does not support GDB non-stop mode (might be implemented in the
future).  Though there is a possible setup where the target does not get
stopped and GDB treats it as it were running.  If the target supports
background access to memory while it is running, you can use GDB in this
mode to inspect memory (mainly global variables) without any intrusion
of the target process.

Remove default setting of gdb-attach event.  *Note Target Events:
targetevents.  Place following command after target configuration:
     $_TARGETNAME configure -event gdb-attach {}

If any of installed flash banks does not support probe on running
target, switch off gdb_memory_map:
     gdb_memory_map disable

Ensure GDB is configured without interrupt-on-connect.  Some GDB
versions set it by default, some does not.
     set remote interrupt-on-connect off

If you switched gdb_memory_map off, you may want to setup GDB memory map
manually or issue 'set mem inaccessible-by-default off'

Now you can issue GDB command 'target extended-remote ...' and inspect
memory of a running target.  Do not use GDB commands 'continue', 'step'
or 'next' as they synchronize GDB with your target and GDB would require
stopping the target to get the prompt back.

Do not use this mode under an IDE like Eclipse as it caches values of
previously shown variables.

It's also possible to connect more than one GDB to the same target by
the target's configuration option '-gdb-max-connections'.  This allows,
for example, one GDB to run a script that continuously polls a set of
variables while other GDB can be used interactively.  Be extremely
careful in this case, because the two GDB can easily get out-of-sync.

20.6 RTOS Support
=================

OpenOCD includes RTOS support, this will however need enabling as it
defaults to disabled.  It can be enabled by passing '-rtos' arg to the
target.  *Note RTOS Type: rtostype.

*Note Debugging Programs with Multiple Threads: (gdb)Threads, for
details about relevant GDB commands.


An example setup is below:

     $_TARGETNAME configure -rtos auto

This will attempt to auto detect the RTOS within your application.

Currently supported rtos's include:
   * 'eCos'
   * 'ThreadX'
   * 'FreeRTOS'
   * 'linux'
   * 'ChibiOS'
   * 'embKernel'
   * 'mqx'
   * 'uCOS-III'
   * 'nuttx'
   * 'RIOT'
   * 'hwthread' (This is not an actual RTOS. *Note Using OpenOCD SMP
     with GDB: usingopenocdsmpwithgdb.)
   * 'Zephyr'

Before an RTOS can be detected, it must export certain symbols;
otherwise, it cannot be used by OpenOCD. Below is a list of the required
symbols for each supported RTOS.

'eCos symbols'
     Cyg_Thread::thread_list, Cyg_Scheduler_Base::current_thread.
'ThreadX symbols'
     _tx_thread_current_ptr, _tx_thread_created_ptr,
     _tx_thread_created_count.
'FreeRTOS symbols'
     pxCurrentTCB, pxReadyTasksLists, xDelayedTaskList1,
     xDelayedTaskList2, pxDelayedTaskList, pxOverflowDelayedTaskList,
     xPendingReadyList, uxCurrentNumberOfTasks, uxTopUsedPriority.
'linux symbols'
     init_task.
'ChibiOS symbols'
     rlist, ch_debug, chSysInit.
'embKernel symbols'
     Rtos::sCurrentTask, Rtos::sListReady, Rtos::sListSleep,
     Rtos::sListSuspended, Rtos::sMaxPriorities,
     Rtos::sCurrentTaskCount.
'mqx symbols'
     _mqx_kernel_data, MQX_init_struct.
'uC/OS-III symbols'
     OSRunning, OSTCBCurPtr, OSTaskDbgListPtr, OSTaskQty.
'nuttx symbols'
     g_readytorun, g_tasklisttable.
'RIOT symbols'
     sched_threads, sched_num_threads, sched_active_pid, max_threads,
     _tcb_name_offset.
'Zephyr symbols'
     _kernel, _kernel_openocd_offsets, _kernel_openocd_size_t_size

For most RTOS supported the above symbols will be exported by default.
However for some, eg.  FreeRTOS, uC/OS-III and Zephyr, extra steps must
be taken.

Zephyr must be compiled with the DEBUG_THREAD_INFO option.  This will
generate some symbols with information needed in order to build the list
of threads.

FreeRTOS and uC/OS-III RTOSes may require additional OpenOCD-specific
file to be linked along with the project:

'FreeRTOS'
     contrib/rtos-helpers/FreeRTOS-openocd.c
'uC/OS-III'
     contrib/rtos-helpers/uCOS-III-openocd.c

20.7 Using OpenOCD SMP with GDB
===============================

OpenOCD includes a pseudo RTOS called _hwthread_ that presents CPU cores
("hardware threads") in an SMP system as threads to GDB. With this
extension, GDB can be used to inspect the state of an SMP system in a
natural way.  After halting the system, using the GDB command 'info
threads' will list the context of each active CPU core in the system.
GDB's 'thread' command can be used to switch the view to a different CPU
core.  The 'step' and 'stepi' commands can be used to step a specific
core while other cores are free-running or remain halted, depending on
the scheduler-locking mode configured in GDB.


File: openocd.info,  Node: Tcl Scripting API,  Next: FAQ,  Prev: GDB and OpenOCD,  Up: Top

21 Tcl Scripting API
********************

21.1 API rules
==============

Tcl commands are stateless; e.g.  the 'telnet' command has a concept of
currently active target, the Tcl API proc's take this sort of state
information as an argument to each proc.

There are three main types of return values: single value, name value
pair list and lists.

Name value pair.  The proc 'foo' below returns a name/value pair list.

     >  set foo(me)  Duane
     >  set foo(you) Oyvind
     >  set foo(mouse) Micky
     >  set foo(duck) Donald

If one does this:

     >  set foo

The result is:

     me Duane you Oyvind mouse Micky duck Donald

Thus, to get the names of the associative array is easy:

foreach { name value } [set foo] {
        puts "Name: $name, Value: $value"
}

Lists returned should be relatively small.  Otherwise, a range should be
passed in to the proc in question.

21.2 Internal low-level Commands
================================

By "low-level", we mean commands that a human would typically not invoke
directly.

   * flash banks <DRIVER> <BASE> <SIZE> <CHIP_WIDTH> <BUS_WIDTH>
     <TARGET> ['driver options' ...]

     Return information about the flash banks

   * capture <COMMAND>

     Run <COMMAND> and return full log output that was produced during
     its execution.  Example:

          > capture "reset init"

OpenOCD commands can consist of two words, e.g.  "flash banks".  The
'startup.tcl' "unknown" proc will translate this into a Tcl proc called
"flash_banks".

21.3 Tcl RPC server
===================

OpenOCD provides a simple RPC server that allows to run arbitrary Tcl
commands and receive the results.

To access it, your application needs to connect to a configured TCP port
(see 'tcl_port').  Then it can pass any string to the interpreter
terminating it with '0x1a' and wait for the return value (it will be
terminated with '0x1a' as well).  This can be repeated as many times as
desired without reopening the connection.

It is not needed anymore to prefix the OpenOCD commands with 'ocd_' to
get the results back.  But sometimes you might need the 'capture'
command.

See 'contrib/rpc_examples/' for specific client implementations.

21.4 Tcl RPC server notifications
=================================

Notifications are sent asynchronously to other commands being executed
over the RPC server, so the port must be polled continuously.

Target event, state and reset notifications are emitted as Tcl
associative arrays in the following format.

type target_event event [event-name]
type target_state state [state-name]
type target_reset mode [reset-mode]

 -- Command: tcl_notifications [on/off]
     Toggle output of target notifications to the current Tcl RPC
     server.  Only available from the Tcl RPC server.  Defaults to off.

21.5 Tcl RPC server trace output
================================

Trace data is sent asynchronously to other commands being executed over
the RPC server, so the port must be polled continuously.

Target trace data is emitted as a Tcl associative array in the following
format.

type target_trace data [trace-data-hex-encoded]

 -- Command: tcl_trace [on/off]
     Toggle output of target trace data to the current Tcl RPC server.
     Only available from the Tcl RPC server.  Defaults to off.

     See an example application here:

22 FAQ
******

  1. RTCK, also known as: Adaptive Clocking - What is it?

     In digital circuit design it is often referred to as "clock
     synchronisation" the JTAG interface uses one clock (TCK or TCLK)
     operating at some speed, your CPU target is operating at another.
     The two clocks are not synchronised, they are "asynchronous"

     In order for the two to work together they must be synchronised
     well enough to work; JTAG can't go ten times faster than the CPU,
     for example.  There are 2 basic options:
       1. Use a special "adaptive clocking" circuit to change the JTAG
          clock rate to match what the CPU currently supports.
       2. The JTAG clock must be fixed at some speed that's enough
          slower than the CPU clock that all TMS and TDI transitions can
          be detected.

     Does this really matter?  For some chips and some situations, this
     is a non-issue, like a 500MHz ARM926 with a 5 MHz JTAG link; the
     CPU has no difficulty keeping up with JTAG. Startup sequences are
     often problematic though, as are other situations where the CPU
     clock rate changes (perhaps to save power).

     For example, Atmel AT91SAM chips start operation from reset with a
     32kHz system clock.  Boot firmware may activate the main oscillator
     and PLL before switching to a faster clock (perhaps that 500 MHz
     ARM926 scenario).  If you're using JTAG to debug that startup
     sequence, you must slow the JTAG clock to sometimes 1 to 4kHz.
     After startup completes, JTAG can use a faster clock.

     Consider also debugging a 500MHz ARM926 hand held battery powered
     device that enters a low power "deep sleep" mode, at 32kHz CPU
     clock, between keystrokes unless it has work to do.  When would
     that 5 MHz JTAG clock be usable?

     Solution #1 - A special circuit

     In order to make use of this, your CPU, board, and JTAG adapter
     must all support the RTCK feature.  Not all of them support this;
     keep reading!

     The RTCK ("Return TCK") signal in some ARM chips is used to help
     with this problem.  ARM has a good description of the problem
     described at this link:
     <http://www.arm.com/support/faqdev/4170.html> [checked
     28/nov/2008].  Link title: "How does the JTAG synchronisation logic
     work?  / how does adaptive clocking work?".

     The nice thing about adaptive clocking is that "battery powered
     hand held device example" - the adaptiveness works perfectly all
     the time.  One can set a break point or halt the system in the deep
     power down code, slow step out until the system speeds up.

     Note that adaptive clocking may also need to work at the board
     level, when a board-level scan chain has multiple chips.  Parallel
     clock voting schemes are good way to implement this, both within
     and between chips, and can easily be implemented with a CPLD. It's
     not difficult to have logic fan a module's input TCK signal out to
     each TAP in the scan chain, and then wait until each TAP's RTCK
     comes back with the right polarity before changing the output RTCK
     signal.  Texas Instruments makes some clock voting logic available
     for free (with no support) in VHDL form; see
     <http://tiexpressdsp.com/index.php/Adaptive_Clocking>

     Solution #2 - Always works - but may be slower

     Often this is a perfectly acceptable solution.

     In most simple terms: Often the JTAG clock must be 1/10 to 1/12 of
     the target clock speed.  But what that "magic division" is varies
     depending on the chips on your board.  ARM rule of thumb Most ARM
     based systems require an 6:1 division; ARM11 cores use an 8:1
     division.  Xilinx rule of thumb is 1/12 the clock speed.

     Note: most full speed FT2232 based JTAG adapters are limited to a
     maximum of 6MHz.  The ones using USB high speed chips (FT2232H)
     often support faster clock rates (and adaptive clocking).

     You can still debug the 'low power' situations - you just need to
     either use a fixed and very slow JTAG clock rate ...  or else
     manually adjust the clock speed at every step.  (Adjusting is
     painful and tedious, and is not always practical.)

     It is however easy to "code your way around it" - i.e.: Cheat a
     little, have a special debug mode in your application that does a
     "high power sleep".  If you are careful - 98% of your problems can
     be debugged this way.

     Note that on ARM you may need to avoid using the _wait for
     interrupt_ operation in your idle loops even if you don't otherwise
     change the CPU clock rate.  That operation gates the CPU clock, and
     thus the JTAG clock; which prevents JTAG access.  One consequence
     is not being able to 'halt' cores which are executing that _wait
     for interrupt_ operation.

     To set the JTAG frequency use the command:

          # Example: 1.234MHz
          adapter speed 1234

  2. Win32 Pathnames Why don't backslashes work in Windows paths?

     OpenOCD uses Tcl and a backslash is an escape char.  Use { and }
     around Windows filenames.

          > echo \a

          > echo {\a}
          \a
          > echo "\a"

          >

  3. Missing: cygwin1.dll OpenOCD complains about a missing cygwin1.dll.

     Make sure you have Cygwin installed, or at least a version of
     OpenOCD that claims to come with all the necessary DLLs.  When
     using Cygwin, try launching OpenOCD from the Cygwin shell.

  4. Breakpoint Issue I'm trying to set a breakpoint using GDB (or a
     front-end like Insight or Eclipse), but OpenOCD complains that
     "Info: arm7_9_common.c:213 arm7_9_add_breakpoint(): sw breakpoint
     requested, but software breakpoints not enabled".

     GDB issues software breakpoints when a normal breakpoint is
     requested, or to implement source-line single-stepping.  On ARMv4T
     systems, like ARM7TDMI, ARM720T or ARM920T, software breakpoints
     consume one of the two available hardware breakpoints.

  5. LPC2000 Flash When erasing or writing LPC2000 on-chip flash, the
     operation fails at random.

     Make sure the core frequency specified in the 'flash lpc2000' line
     matches the clock at the time you're programming the flash.  If
     you've specified the crystal's frequency, make sure the PLL is
     disabled.  If you've specified the full core speed (e.g.  60MHz),
     make sure the PLL is enabled.

  6. Amontec Chameleon When debugging using an Amontec Chameleon in its
     JTAG Accelerator configuration, I keep getting "Error:
     amt_jtagaccel.c:184 amt_wait_scan_busy(): amt_jtagaccel timed out
     while waiting for end of scan, rtck was disabled".

     Make sure your PC's parallel port operates in EPP mode.  You might
     have to try several settings in your PC BIOS (ECP, EPP, and
     different versions of those).

  7. Data Aborts When debugging with OpenOCD and GDB (plain GDB,
     Insight, or Eclipse), I get lots of "Error: arm7_9_common.c:1771
     arm7_9_read_memory(): memory read caused data abort".

     The errors are non-fatal, and are the result of GDB trying to trace
     stack frames beyond the last valid frame.  It might be possible to
     prevent this by setting up a proper "initial" stack frame, if you
     happen to know what exactly has to be done, feel free to add this
     here.

     Simple: In your startup code - push 8 registers of zeros onto the
     stack before calling main().  What GDB is doing is "climbing" the
     run time stack by reading various values on the stack using the
     standard call frame for the target.  GDB keeps going - until one of
     2 things happen #1 an invalid frame is found, or #2 some huge
     number of stackframes have been processed.  By pushing zeros on the
     stack, GDB gracefully stops.

     Debugging Interrupt Service Routines - In your ISR before you call
     your C code, do the same - artificially push some zeros onto the
     stack, remember to pop them off when the ISR is done.

     Also note: If you have a multi-threaded operating system, they
     often do not in the interest of saving memory waste these few
     bytes.  Painful...

  8. JTAG Reset Config I get the following message in the OpenOCD
     console (or log file): "Warning: arm7_9_common.c:679
     arm7_9_assert_reset(): srst resets test logic, too".

     This warning doesn't indicate any serious problem, as long as you
     don't want to debug your core right out of reset.  Your .cfg file
     specified 'reset_config trst_and_srst srst_pulls_trst' to tell
     OpenOCD that either your board, your debugger or your target uC
     (e.g.  LPC2000) can't assert the two reset signals independently.
     With this setup, it's not possible to halt the core right out of
     reset, everything else should work fine.

  9. USB Power When using OpenOCD in conjunction with Amontec JTAGkey
     and the Yagarto toolchain (Eclipse, arm-elf-gcc, arm-elf-gdb), the
     debugging seems to be unstable.  When single-stepping over large
     blocks of code, GDB and OpenOCD quit with an error message.  Is
     there a stability issue with OpenOCD?

     No, this is not a stability issue concerning OpenOCD. Most users
     have solved this issue by simply using a self-powered USB hub,
     which they connect their Amontec JTAGkey to.  Apparently, some
     computers do not provide a USB power supply stable enough for the
     Amontec JTAGkey to be operated.

     Laptops running on battery have this problem too...

  10. GDB Disconnects When using the Amontec JTAGkey, sometimes OpenOCD
     crashes with the following error message: "Error: gdb_server.c:101
     gdb_get_char(): read: 10054".  What does that mean and what might
     be the reason for this?

     Error code 10054 corresponds to WSAECONNRESET, which means that the
     debugger (GDB) has closed the connection to OpenOCD. This might be
     a GDB issue.

  11. LPC2000 Flash In the configuration file in the section where flash
     device configurations are described, there is a parameter for
     specifying the clock frequency for LPC2000 internal flash devices
     (e.g.  'flash bank $_FLASHNAME lpc2000 0x0 0x40000 0 0 $_TARGETNAME
     lpc2000_v1 14746 calc_checksum'), which must be specified in
     kilohertz.  However, I do have a quartz crystal of a frequency that
     contains fractions of kilohertz (e.g.  14,745,600 Hz, i.e.
     14,745.600 kHz).  Is it possible to specify real numbers for the
     clock frequency?

     No.  The clock frequency specified here must be given as an
     integral number.  However, this clock frequency is used by the
     In-Application-Programming (IAP) routines of the LPC2000 family
     only, which seems to be very tolerant concerning the given clock
     frequency, so a slight difference between the specified clock
     frequency and the actual clock frequency will not cause any
     trouble.

  12. Command Order Do I have to keep a specific order for the commands
     in the configuration file?

     Well, yes and no.  Commands can be given in arbitrary order, yet
     the devices listed for the JTAG scan chain must be given in the
     right order (jtag newdevice), with the device closest to the
     TDO-Pin being listed first.  In general, whenever objects of the
     same type exist which require an index number, then these objects
     must be given in the right order (jtag newtap, targets and flash
     banks - a target references a jtag newtap and a flash bank
     references a target).

     You can use the "scan_chain" command to verify and display the tap
     order.

     Also, some commands can't execute until after 'init' has been
     processed.  Such commands include 'nand probe' and everything else
     that needs to write to controller registers, perhaps for setting up
     DRAM and loading it with code.

  13. JTAG TAP Order Do I have to declare the TAPS in some particular
     order?

     Yes; whenever you have more than one, you must declare them in the
     same order used by the hardware.

     Many newer devices have multiple JTAG TAPs.  For example:
     STMicroelectronics STM32 chips have two TAPs, a "boundary scan TAP"
     and "Cortex-M3" TAP. Example: The STM32 reference manual, Document
     ID: RM0008, Section 26.5, Figure 259, page 651/681, the "TDI" pin
     is connected to the boundary scan TAP, which then connects to the
     Cortex-M3 TAP, which then connects to the TDO pin.

     Thus, the proper order for the STM32 chip is: (1) The Cortex-M3,
     then (2) The boundary scan TAP. If your board includes an
     additional JTAG chip in the scan chain (for example a Xilinx CPLD
     or FPGA) you could place it before or after the STM32 chip in the
     chain.  For example:

        * OpenOCD_TDI(output) -> STM32 TDI Pin (BS Input)
        * STM32 BS TDO (output) -> STM32 Cortex-M3 TDI (input)
        * STM32 Cortex-M3 TDO (output) -> SM32 TDO Pin
        * STM32 TDO Pin (output) -> Xilinx TDI Pin (input)
        * Xilinx TDO Pin -> OpenOCD TDO (input)

     The "jtag device" commands would thus be in the order shown below.
     Note:

        * jtag newtap Xilinx tap -irlen ...
        * jtag newtap stm32 cpu -irlen ...
        * jtag newtap stm32 bs -irlen ...
        * # Create the debug target and say where it is
        * target create stm32.cpu -chain-position stm32.cpu ...

  14. SYSCOMP Sometimes my debugging session terminates with an error.
     When I look into the log file, I can see these error messages:
     Error: arm7_9_common.c:561 arm7_9_execute_sys_speed(): timeout
     waiting for SYSCOMP

     TODO.

23 Tcl Crash Course
*******************

Not everyone knows Tcl - this is not intended to be a replacement for
learning Tcl, the intent of this chapter is to give you some idea of how
the Tcl scripts work.

This chapter is written with two audiences in mind.  (1) OpenOCD users
who need to understand a bit more of how Jim-Tcl works so they can do
something useful, and (2) those that want to add a new command to
OpenOCD.

23.1 Tcl Rule #1
================

There is a famous joke, it goes like this:
  1. Rule #1: The wife is always correct
  2. Rule #2: If you think otherwise, See Rule #1

The Tcl equal is this:

  1. Rule #1: Everything is a string
  2. Rule #2: If you think otherwise, See Rule #1

As in the famous joke, the consequences of Rule #1 are profound.  Once
you understand Rule #1, you will understand Tcl.

23.2 Tcl Rule #1b
=================

There is a second pair of rules.
  1. Rule #1: Control flow does not exist.  Only commands
     For example: the classic FOR loop or IF statement is not a control
     flow item, they are commands, there is no such thing as control
     flow in Tcl.
  2. Rule #2: If you think otherwise, See Rule #1
     Actually what happens is this: There are commands that by
     convention, act like control flow key words in other languages.
     One of those commands is the word "for", another command is "if".

23.3 Per Rule #1 - All Results are strings
==========================================

Every Tcl command results in a string.  The word "result" is used
deliberately.  No result is just an empty string.  Remember: Rule #1 -
Everything is a string

23.4 Tcl Quoting Operators
==========================

In life of a Tcl script, there are two important periods of time, the
difference is subtle.
  1. Parse Time
  2. Evaluation Time

The two key items here are how "quoted things" work in Tcl.  Tcl has
three primary quoting constructs, the [square-brackets] the
{curly-braces} and "double-quotes"

By now you should know $VARIABLES always start with a $DOLLAR sign.
BTW: To set a variable, you actually use the command "set", as in "set
VARNAME VALUE" much like the ancient BASIC language "let x = 1"
statement, but without the equal sign.

   * [square-brackets]
     [square-brackets] are command substitutions.  It operates much like
     Unix Shell 'back-ticks'.  The result of a [square-bracket]
     operation is exactly 1 string.  Remember Rule #1 - Everything is a
     string.  These two statements are roughly identical:
              # bash example
              X=`date`
              echo "The Date is: $X"
              # Tcl example
              set X [date]
              puts "The Date is: $X"
   * "double-quoted-things"
     "double-quoted-things" are just simply quoted text.  $VARIABLES and
     [square-brackets] are expanded in place - the result however is
     exactly 1 string.  Remember Rule #1 - Everything is a string
              set x "Dinner"
              puts "It is now \"[date]\", $x is in 1 hour"
   * {Curly-Braces}
     {Curly-Braces} are magic: $VARIABLES and [square-brackets] are
     parsed, but are NOT expanded or executed.  {Curly-Braces} are like
     'single-quote' operators in BASH shell scripts, with the added
     feature: {curly-braces} can be nested, single quotes can not.
     {{{this is nested 3 times}}} NOTE: [date] is a bad example; at this
     writing, Jim/OpenOCD does not have a date command.

23.5 Consequences of Rule 1/2/3/4
=================================

The consequences of Rule 1 are profound.

23.5.1 Tokenisation & Execution.
--------------------------------

Of course, whitespace, blank lines and #comment lines are handled in the
normal way.

As a script is parsed, each (multi) line in the script file is tokenised
and according to the quoting rules.  After tokenisation, that line is
immediately executed.

Multi line statements end with one or more "still-open" {curly-braces}
which - eventually - closes a few lines later.

23.5.2 Command Execution
------------------------

Remember earlier: There are no "control flow" statements in Tcl.
Instead there are COMMANDS that simply act like control flow operators.

Commands are executed like this:

  1. Parse the next line into (argc) and (argv[]).
  2. Look up (argv[0]) in a table and call its function.
  3. Repeat until End Of File.

It sort of works like this:
         for(;;){
             ReadAndParse( &argc, &argv );

             cmdPtr = LookupCommand( argv[0] );

             (*cmdPtr->Execute)( argc, argv );
         }

When the command "proc" is parsed (which creates a procedure function)
it gets 3 parameters on the command line.  1 the name of the proc
(function), 2 the list of parameters, and 3 the body of the function.
Note the choice of words: LIST and BODY. The PROC command stores these
items in a table somewhere so it can be found by "LookupCommand()"

23.5.3 The FOR command
----------------------

The most interesting command to look at is the FOR command.  In Tcl, the
FOR command is normally implemented in C. Remember, FOR is a command
just like any other command.

When the ascii text containing the FOR command is parsed, the parser
produces 5 parameter strings, (If in doubt: Refer to Rule #1) they are:

  0. The ascii text 'for'
  1. The start text
  2. The test expression
  3. The next text
  4. The body text

Sort of reminds you of "main( int argc, char **argv )" does it not?
Remember Rule #1 - Everything is a string.  The key point is this: Often
many of those parameters are in {curly-braces} - thus the variables
inside are not expanded or replaced until later.

Remember that every Tcl command looks like the classic "main( argc, argv
)" function in C. In JimTCL - they actually look like this:

     int
     MyCommand( Jim_Interp *interp,
                int *argc,
                Jim_Obj * const *argvs );

Real Tcl is nearly identical.  Although the newer versions have
introduced a byte-code parser and interpreter, but at the core, it still
operates in the same basic way.

23.5.4 FOR command implementation
---------------------------------

To understand Tcl it is perhaps most helpful to see the FOR command.
Remember, it is a COMMAND not a control flow structure.

In Tcl there are two underlying C helper functions.

Remember Rule #1 - You are a string.

The first helper parses and executes commands found in an ascii string.
Commands can be separated by semicolons, or newlines.  While parsing,
variables are expanded via the quoting rules.

The second helper evaluates an ascii string as a numerical expression
and returns a value.

Here is an example of how the FOR command could be implemented.  The
pseudo code below does not show error handling.
     void Execute_AsciiString( void *interp, const char *string );

     int Evaluate_AsciiExpression( void *interp, const char *string );

     int
     MyForCommand( void *interp,
                   int argc,
                   char **argv )
     {
        if( argc != 5 ){
            SetResult( interp, "WRONG number of parameters");
            return ERROR;
        }

        // argv[0] = the ascii string just like C

        // Execute the start statement.
        Execute_AsciiString( interp, argv[1] );

        // Top of loop test
        for(;;){
             i = Evaluate_AsciiExpression(interp, argv[2]);
             if( i == 0 )
                 break;

             // Execute the body
             Execute_AsciiString( interp, argv[3] );

             // Execute the LOOP part
             Execute_AsciiString( interp, argv[4] );
         }

         // Return no error
         SetResult( interp, "" );
         return SUCCESS;
     }

Every other command IF, WHILE, FORMAT, PUTS, EXPR, everything works in
the same basic way.

23.6 OpenOCD Tcl Usage
======================

23.6.1 source and find commands
-------------------------------

Where: In many configuration files
Example: source [find FILENAME]
Remember the parsing rules
  1. The 'find' command is in square brackets, and is executed with the
     parameter FILENAME. It should find and return the full path to a
     file with that name; it uses an internal search path.  The RESULT
     is a string, which is substituted into the command line in place of
     the bracketed 'find' command.  (Don't try to use a FILENAME which
     includes the "#" character.  That character begins Tcl comments.)
  2. The 'source' command is executed with the resulting filename; it
     reads a file and executes as a script.

23.6.2 format command
---------------------

Where: Generally occurs in numerous places.
Tcl has no command like printf(), instead it has format, which is really
more like sprintf().  Example
         set x 6
         set y 7
         puts [format "The answer: %d" [expr {$x * $y}]]
  1. The SET command creates 2 variables, X and Y.
  2. The double [nested] EXPR command performs math
     The EXPR command produces numerical result as a string.
     Refer to Rule #1
  3. The format command is executed, producing a single string
     Refer to Rule #1.
  4. The PUTS command outputs the text.

23.6.3 Body or Inlined Text
---------------------------

Where: Various TARGET scripts.
     #1 Good
        proc someproc {} {
            ... multiple lines of stuff ...
        }
        $_TARGETNAME configure -event FOO someproc
     #2 Good - no variables
        $_TARGETNAME configure -event foo "this ; that;"
     #3 Good Curly Braces
        $_TARGETNAME configure -event FOO {
             puts "Time: [date]"
        }
     #4 DANGER DANGER DANGER
        $_TARGETNAME configure -event foo "puts \"Time: [date]\""
  1. The $_TARGETNAME is an OpenOCD variable convention.
     $_TARGETNAME represents the last target created, the value changes
     each time a new target is created.  Remember the parsing rules.
     When the ascii text is parsed, the $_TARGETNAME becomes a simple
     string, the name of the target which happens to be a TARGET
     (object) command.
  2. The 2nd parameter to the '-event' parameter is a TCBODY
     There are 4 examples:
       1. The TCLBODY is a simple string that happens to be a proc name
       2. The TCLBODY is several simple commands separated by semicolons
       3. The TCLBODY is a multi-line {curly-brace} quoted string
       4. The TCLBODY is a string with variables that get expanded.

     In the end, when the target event FOO occurs the TCLBODY is
     evaluated.  Method #1 and #2 are functionally identical.  For
     Method #3 and #4 it is more interesting.  What is the TCLBODY?

     Remember the parsing rules.  In case #3, {curly-braces} mean the
     $VARS and [square-brackets] are expanded later, when the EVENT
     occurs, and the text is evaluated.  In case #4, they are replaced
     before the "Target Object Command" is executed.  This occurs at the
     same time $_TARGETNAME is replaced.  In case #4 the date will never
     change.  {BTW: [date] is a bad example; at this writing,
     Jim/OpenOCD does not have a date command}

23.6.4 Global Variables
-----------------------

Where: You might discover this when writing your own procs
In simple terms: Inside a PROC, if you need to access a global variable
you must say so.  See also "upvar".  Example:
     proc myproc { } {
          set y 0 #Local variable Y
          global x #Global variable X
          puts [format "X=%d, Y=%d" $x $y]
     }

23.7 Other Tcl Hacks
====================

Dynamic variable creation
     # Dynamically create a bunch of variables.
     for { set x 0 } { $x < 32 } { set x [expr {$x + 1}]} {
         # Create var name
         set vn [format "BIT%d" $x]
         # Make it a global
         global $vn
         # Set it.
         set $vn [expr {1 << $x}]
     }
Dynamic proc/command creation
     # One "X" function - 5 uart functions.
     foreach who {A B C D E}
        proc [format "show_uart%c" $who] { } "show_UARTx $who"
     }

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
     so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
